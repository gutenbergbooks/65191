  <h2 class='c006'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Much</span> of Douglas Jerrold’s writing took essay form although
he only applied the title to five short pieces which
were added as <i>Essays</i> to <i>The Chronicles of Clovernook</i> in
1846. Those five pieces are included in this volume along
with others from his collected works, and from among those
scattered contributions to periodicals which have been
brought together at various times since his death.</p>

<p class='c010'>Born in London on January 3rd, 1803, Douglas William
Jerrold was the youngest son of a theatrical manager then
of the Kent circuit. His baby years were passed at
Cranbrook, his childhood at Sheerness, and then, not
having quite attained the mature age of eleven, he was
entered as a first-class volunteer on board the <i>Namur</i>, guardship
at the Nore, on December 22, 1813. Here in the ship’s
school his education was continued, and here the midshipman
was allowed privileges dear to the boyish heart; he
was permitted to keep pigeons, and not the least of his
privileges was the being permitted the use of the captain’s
collection of books—that captain, it is pleasant to recall,
being a brother of Jane Austen. About fifteen months
after joining the <i>Namur</i> he was transferred to the brig
<i>Ernest</i>, engaged in convoying transports and in bringing
home wounded soldiers from the Continent. Then came
Waterloo and Peace. In October 1815 the <i>Ernest</i> was
paid off and the boy-officer returned to civil life. At the
end of the year the Jerrold family left Sheerness for
London, and Douglas made a new start as printer’s
apprentice, and perseveringly pursued a rigorous plan of
self-education. Then he began writing verses and plays,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>and when he was eighteen his first piece was represented on
the stage. Play-writing and slight journalism were combined
with the compositor’s work for a few years before,
throwing aside the composing stick, he relied entirely on
the pen. Numerous plays—of many of which nothing
beyond the names is now recoverable—were written before
Douglas Jerrold made his “hit” with <i>Black-eyed Susan</i> in
1829. Thenceforward he was a busy playwright and a constant
contributor to the magazines, annuals and newspapers.
In 1841 the advent of <i>Punch</i> introduced him to a medium
peculiarly suited to his genius, and to that periodical he
contributed his most popular work, <i>Mrs Caudle’s Curtain
Lectures</i>, and one of his best novels, <i>The Story of a Feather</i>.
To the <i>Illuminated Magazine</i> (1843-4) and <i>Douglas
Jerrold’s Shilling Magazine</i> (1845-8), both of which he
edited, he contributed many characteristic essays and stories,
but later he devoted himself more particularly to political
writing as editor of <i>Douglas Jerrold’s Weekly Newspaper</i>
(1846-8), and of <i>Lloyd’s Weekly Newspaper</i> (1852-7).
He died on June 8th, 1857.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have heard much within recent years for and against
fiction “with a purpose,” as though this was some new
literary manifestation. Among the best remembered writers
of the early Victorian era are just those who had a
purpose other than that of merely amusing their readers—Thackeray
and Dickens are of course the two most striking
examples. The author’s purpose is often the salt not only
flavouring his work for immediate contemporaries, but
also preserving it for future readers. That with Douglas
Jerrold this purpose counted for much we have his own
words to show. Prefacing one of his serial ventures he said:
“It will be our chief object to make every essay—however
brief, and however light and familiar in its treatment—breathe
<i>with a purpose</i>. Experience assures us that,
especially at the present day, it is <i>by a defined purpose alone</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>whether significant in twenty pages or in twenty lines,
that the sympathies of the world are to be engaged, and its
support insured.” That this conviction was at the back of
the greater part of Douglas Jerrold’s writings no student of
his work can fail to recognise. The fact is perhaps answerable
for much of his work having enjoyed but a temporary
popularity, for there are two ways of writing “with a
purpose”—the first the topical or journalistic way, and the
second the general or more philosophical. Yet if Douglas
Jerrold expended himself to a considerable extent over the
particular, he by no means neglected the general, of which
there is abundant testimony in this volume, as well as in
<i>St Giles and St James</i>, <i>The Story of a Feather</i>, <i>Punch’s
Letters</i>, and that little book of golden philosophy, <i>The
Chronicles of Clovernook</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The essays collected into this volume are, as has been
hinted, from various sources; the earliest dates from the
late ’twenties, the latest from the last year of the author’s
life. No attempt has been made to place them chronologically.
It has seemed well to keep the five Shakespearean
essays together, representing as they do a life-long interest
of their author’s. In the early ’thirties Douglas Jerrold and
a number of other young Shakespeare enthusiasts—William
Godwin the Younger, Laman Blanchard, Kenny Meadows,
etc.—formed the Mulberry Club, at the gatherings of
which essays and verses were read by the members; some
certainly of the following papers formed part of the club’s
“Mulberry Leaves,” as also did the same writer’s song on
<i>Shakespeare’s Crab Tree</i>, a song which may be quoted
here, as it is not widely known, to complete Jerrold’s
“leaves.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With reference to the first of the following essays there
recently came into my hands an interesting letter from the
author, which may well be quoted here. Walter Savage
Landor’s <i>Citation and Examination of William Shakespeare</i>
had been published in 1834, and apparently Jerrold’s
correspondent had pointed out the similarity of theme:—</p>

<div class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>11 Thistle Grove, Little Chelsea</span>,</div>
<div class='c014'>“<i>August 6th (1835)</i>.</div>

<p class='c015'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Sir</span>,—<i>The Trial of Shakespeare</i> was, I think,
published by Bentley. I have only read extracts from it in
reviews; and though therein I recognised <i>nothing similar to my
little sketch</i>, nevertheless the publication of the book does, on
consideration, seem to preoccupy the subject. I concluded
that you had seen something of the volume, or should
before have pointed it out to you. If you please—for I
confess myself somewhat thin-skinned under any charge
of plagiary, the more especially when unmerited—you may
omit the first legend.</p>

<p class='c015'>“For the second, it has never yet seen the light; nor am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>I aware of the existence of any essay to which even the
uncharitableness of criticism might imagine a resemblance.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It struck me, on reading it, that were it broken up
more into paragraphs—as new objects are introduced—it
would be more effective. As it is the images crowding
so closely upon each other—(whilst the spirit of the essay
depends upon the distinctness with which they represent
the several plays)—may confuse, and thus fail to satisfy
the reader. If you think with me, and will again favour
me with the proof, I will make the alterations with as
little trouble as possible to the printer. There being now
only one legend, I should call the paper <i>Shakespeare at
Bank-side</i>.—I am, my dear Sir, yours truly,</p>
<div class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>Douglas Jerrold</span>.”</div>

<p class='c015'>“<span class='sc'>W. H. Harrison</span>, Esq.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Beyond the fact that they both deal with the tradition of
Shakespeare’s deer-stealing escapade and departure from
Stratford-on-Avon, there is but little similarity between
Douglas Jerrold’s brief essay and Landor’s much longer
work. With reference to <i>Shakespeare in China</i> it may be
of interest to point out—the author in satirising his fellow
countryman later used the fiction of describing English
characters from the Chinese point of view in <i>Punch</i> of May
25th, 1844.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the first few essays testify to the author’s loving
homage to Shakespeare, others in no uncertain voice proclaim
his political radicalism, his detestation of war, and his
sense of the truth that man’s inhumanity to man makes
countless thousands mourn. In <i>Recollections of Guy Fawkes</i>
the references to the Isle of Sheppy “some five and twenty
years ago” are reminiscences of Jerrold’s boyhood at
Sheerness. The pleasant little homily on human consistency,
<i>The Manager’s Pig</i>, is said to have been founded
in fact; the manager in question being Davidge of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>Coburg Theatre, to whom Jerrold was for a time “household
author” at a weekly salary. The series of <i>Cat-and-Fiddle
Moralities</i> so auspiciously begun with <i>The Tale of a
Tiger</i> was not pursued any further. <i>The Drill Sergeant</i> and <i>The
Greenwich Pensioner</i> formed part of a series of <i>Full Lengths</i>,
contributed to the <i>Monthly Magazine</i> in 1826-7; there
were at least six of them, but as I have not been able to consult
a complete set of the magazine, I have only been able to
trace three—the two given and one on <i>The Ship Clergyman</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the closing item of this collection we have a satiric
essay of a sort, which seems to have been in the air at the
time; it was published originally in 1839 with illustrations
by Phiz, at the same time that Thackeray by contributing
his <i>Catherine</i> to <i>Fraser’s</i> was also seeking to discredit “the
Newgate school” of fiction. Later, in <i>Punch</i>, Douglas
Jerrold reverted to the “Newgate novel-mongers,” mentioning
them as still a power, and showing that satire had not
stopped the demand for their productions; and in one of
the most popular of his comedies a character is made to say,
“When I was young, girls used to read <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>,
<i>Jeremy Taylor</i>, and such books of innocence; now, young
ladies know the ways of Newgate as well as the turnkeys.
Then, books gave girls hearty, healthy food; now, silly
things, like larks in cages, they live upon hemp-seed.”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>SHAKESPEARE AT CHARLECOTE PARK</h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a fine May morning when the bailiff of Sir Thomas
Lucy, of Charlecote, attended by some half-dozen serving
men, rode quickly through the streets of Stratford, and
halted at the abode of his worship the Mayor. The
children in the street stood mute, and stared; gossips
ran to door and casement; Thrums, the tailor, mechanically
twitched off his cap, and for a moment forgot the new
bridal jerkin of Martin Lapworth, the turner, of Henley
Street; John-a-Combe, the thrifty money-scrivener, startled
from a sum of arithmetic, watched the horsemen with
peering eyes and open mouth; and every face expressed
astonishment and surmise as the horses’ hoofs tore up the
road, and the arms of the riders rang and clattered; and
their visages, burly and glowing, showed as of men bearing
mighty tidings. Had a thunderbolt fallen in the market-place,
it could not more suddenly have broken the tranquillity
of Stratford than had the sudden visit of Sir Thomas
Lucy’s retainers. Every one pressed to the Mayor’s house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>to learn the tidings, and in a brief time one, taking up the
fears of his neighbour for the truth, told an inquiring third
that the swarthy Spaniard, with a thousand ships, had
entered the Thames; that her gracious highness the Queen
was a close prisoner in the Tower, and that the damnable
papists had carried the host through the city, and had
performed High Mass in the Abbey of Westminster. This
rumour was opposed by another, averring that the Queen
had drunk poison in a quart of sherris (a beverage much
loved by her highness)—whilst a fourth story told of her
private marriage with the Master of the Horse. Great
wonderment followed on each tale. Some vowed they
would never be brought to speak Spanish, others religiously
called for fire upon all Catholics—whilst more than one
good housewife hoped that in all reasonable time her
Majesty would bring forth a prince. Stratford was the
very court-place for rumour; old, yellow Avon paused in
his course, astonished at the hum and buzz that came with
every wind.</p>

<p class='c010'>At length the truth became manifest. No Spanish
bottom poisoned the Thames; no Spanish flag blasted
the air of England. Elizabeth yet gripped her sceptre—yet
indulged in undrugged sack and cold virginity. Still
it was no mean event that could thrust seven of Sir Thomas
Lucy’s men into their saddles, and send them galloping,
like so many St Georges, to the Mayor of Stratford. Thus
it was then; the park of Sir Thomas had been entered on
the over-night, and one fine head of fallow deer stolen from
the pasturage, whilst another was found sorely maimed,
sobbing out its life among the underwood. The marauders
were known, and Sir Thomas had sent to his worship to
apprehend the evil-doers, and despatch them under a safe
guard to the hall of Charlecote. This simple story mightily
disappointed the worthy denizens of Stratford, and, for the
most part, sent them back to their various business. Many,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>however, lingered about his worship’s dwelling to catch a
view of the culprits—for they were soon in custody—and
many a head was thrust from the windows to look at the
offenders, as, mounted on horseback, and well guarded on
all sides by Sir Thomas Lucy’s servants and the constables
of Stratford, they took their way through the town, and,
crossing the Avon, turned on the left to Charlecote.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were four criminals, and all in the first flush of
manhood; they rode as gaily among their guards as though
each carried a hawk upon his fist and were ambling to the
sound of Milan bells. One of the culprits was specially
distinguished from his companions, more by the perfect
beauty of his face than by the laughing unconcern that
shone in it. He seemed about twenty-two years of age, of
somewhat more than ordinary stature, his limbs combining
gracefulness of form with manly strength. He sat upon
his saddle as though he grew there. His countenance was
of extraordinary sweetness. He had an eye, at once so
brilliant and so deep, so various in its expression, so keenly
piercing, yet so meltingly soft—an eye so wonderful and
instant in its power as though it could read the whole
world at a glance—such an eye as hardly ever shone within
the face of man; it was not an eye of flesh—it was a living
soul. His nose and chin were shaped as with a chisel
from the fairest marble; his mouth looked instinct with
thought, yet as sweet and gentle in its expression as
is an infant’s when it dreams and smiles. And as he
doffed his hat to a fair head that looked mournfully at
him from an upper casement, his broad forehead bared out
from his dark curls in surpassing power and amplitude. It
seemed a tablet writ with a new world.</p>

<p class='c010'>The townspeople gazed at the young man, and some of
them said, “Poor Will Shakespeare!” Others said, “’Twas
a sore thing to get a child for the gallows!” and one old
crone lifted up her lean hands and cried, “God help poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Anne Hathaway, she had better married the tailor!”
Some prophesied a world of trouble for the young man’s
parents; many railed him as a scapegrace given to loose
companions, a mischievous varlet, a midnight roysterer;
but the greater number only cried, “Poor Will Shakespeare!”
It was but a short ride to the hall, yet ere the
escort had arrived there Sir Thomas Lucy with some choice
guests were seated at dinner.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hereupon the constables were ordered to take especial
care of the culprits, who were forthwith consigned to the
darkest and strongest cellar at Charlecote. Here, at least,
it was thought that Will Shakespeare would abate somewhat
of his unseemly hardihood, for all the way to the
mansion he had laughed and jested and made riddles on
the constables’ beards, and sang snatches of profane songs,
and kissed his fingers to the damsels on the road, and, indeed,
“showed himself,” as a discreet, observing nun declared,
“little better than a child of Satan.” In the cellar he and
his co-mates, it was thought, would mend their manners.
“As they do not learn to respect God, and worship Sir
Thomas, and honour deer’s flesh, as good Christians ought—and
they learn not these things in the dark—’tis to waste
God’s gifts upon ’em to let ’em see the light of day.” Thus
spoke Ralph Elder, constable of Stratford, to one of the
grooms of Charlecote. “I tell you, John,” continued the
functionary, “Will Shakespeare’s horse didn’t stumble
for nothing at the field of hemp. God saves poor babes
born to be hanged, for ’tis no constable’s affair——Hush!
mercy on us, they laugh—laugh like lords!”</p>

<p class='c010'>To the shame of the prisoners be it spoken, the discourse
of Ralph was broken by a loud shout from the cellar. To
add to the abomination, the captives trolled forth in full
concert a song—“a scornful thing,” as Ralph afterwards
declared it, “against the might and authority of Sir Thomas
Lucy.” The men, the maids—all flocked to the cellar door,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>while the dungeon of the prisoners rang with their shouting
voices. “It was thus they glorified,” as Ralph avowed,
“in their past iniquities”:—</p>

<p class='c010'>The household were truly scandalised at this bravado.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>The night came on, and still the prisoners sang and laughed.
In the morning Sir Thomas took his chair of state, and
ordered the culprits to his presence. The servants hurried
to the cellar—but the birds were flown. How they effected
their escape remaineth to this day a mystery, though it
cannot be disguised that heavy suspicion fell upon four of
the maids. The story went that Shakespeare was a day or
two afterwards passed on the London road.</p>

<p class='c010'>This tale was corroborated by John-a-Combes. For,
many years afterwards, a townsman of Stratford, who had
quitted his native place for the Indies just at the time that
Warwickshire rang with the deeds of the deer-stealers,
returned home, and amongst other gossip was heard to ask
the thrifty money-getter what became of that rare spark,
Will Shakespeare, him who entered Sir Thomas’s park at
Charlecote. “Marry, sir,” replied John; “the worst has
become of him, for after that robbery he went to London,
where he turned stage actor, and writ plays, <i>King Lear</i>,

  <h2 class='c006'>SHAKESPEARE AT “BANK-SIDE”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> bell of St Mary Overy had struck three; the flag was
just displayed from the Rose play-house; and, rustling in the
wind, was like, in the words of the pious Philip Stubbes,
“unto a false harlot, flaunting the unwary onward to
destruction and to death.” Barges and boats, filled with
the flower of the court-end and the city, crowded to the
bridge. Gallants, in the pride of new cloak and doublet,
leaped to the shore, making rich the strand with many a
fair gentlewoman lifted all tenderly from the craft; horses
pranced along Bank-side, spurred by their riders to the door
of the tiring-room; nay, there was no man, woman, or
child who did not seem beckoned by the Rose flag to the
play,—whose ears did not drink in the music of the trumpets,
as though it was the most ravishing sound of the earth. At
length the trumpets ceased, and the play began.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f2'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>According to Rowe’s story, related to Pope, Shakespeare’s first
employment in London was to wait at the door of the play-house
and hold the horses of those that had no servants, that they might
be ready after the performance. “But I cannot,” says Mr
Steevens, “dismiss this anecdote without observing, that it seems
to want every mark of probability.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The Rose was crammed. In the penny gallery was many
an apprentice unlawfully dispensing his master’s time—it
might be, his master’s penny too. Many a husband, slunk
from a shrew’s pipe and hands, was there, to list and shake
the head at the player’s tale of wedded love. Nor here and
there was wanting, peeping from a nook, with cap pulled
over the brow, and ruff huddled about the neck, the sly,
happy face of one, who yesterday gave an assenting groan to
the charitable wonder of a godly neighbour—of one who
marvelled that the Rose flag should flout the heavens, yet
call not down the penal fire. The yard was thronged; and
on the stage was many a bird of courtly feather, perched on
his sixpenny stool; whilst the late comer lay at length upon
the rushes, his thoughts wrested from his hose and points
by the mystery of the play.</p>

<p class='c010'>Happy, thrice happy wights, thus fenced and rounded in
from the leprous, eating cares of life! Happy ye, who, even
with a penny piece, can transport yourselves into a land of
fairy—can lull the pains of flesh with the music of high
thoughts! The play goes on, with all its influences. Where
is the courtier? Ten thousand miles from the glassy floor of
a palace, lying on a bank, listening to a reed piping in Arcady.
Where the man of thrift? He hath shuffled off his trading
suit, and dreams himself a shepherd of the golden time.
Where the wife-ridden husband, doubtful of a natural right
to his own soul? He is an Indian emperor, flushed with the
mastery of ten thousand slaves! Where is the poor apprentice—he
who hath weals upon his back for twopence lost
on Wednesday? He is in El Dorado, strutting upon gold.
Thus works the play—let it go on. Our business calls us
to the outside.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is scarcely a passenger to be seen on Bank-side.
Three or four boys loiter about the theatre, some trying,
through a deceitful crevice, to catch a glimpse of the play—some
tending horses, until the show be done. Apart from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>these, his arms crossed, leaning against a post, his eyes
fixed on the Rose flag,—stands a youth, whose face, though
perfect in its beauty, has yet a troubled air. As he stands,
watching the rustling beacon, it almost seems—so fixed is
his look—as though he held some converse with it; as
though the fortunes of his future life were woven in its web
in mystic characters, and he, with his spirit straining from
his eyes, were seeking to decipher them. Now—so would
imagination work—there seemed voluble speech in its flapping
folds, and now a visible face. The youth turned from
gazing on the flag to the open river. Some spirit was upon
him; and, through his eyes, gave to vulgar objects a new and
startling form. He was in a day-dream of wonder and
beauty; and as it is told that those doomed to the ocean with
hearts yearning for the land see fields and pleasant gardens
in the heaving wave,—so our hero, tricked by his errant
fancy, gazed breathless at new wonders sweeping before
him. A golden mist shrouded the mansions and warehouses
on the strand. Each common thing of earth glowed
and dilated under the creative spirit of the dreamer. The
Thames seemed fixed—whilst a thousand forms moved along
the silver pavement. The sky shone brighter—harmony
was in the air! The shades move on.</p>

<p class='c010'>First passes one bearing in his hand a skull: wisdom is in
his eyes, music on his tongue—the soul of contemplation in
the flesh of an Apollo: the greatest wonder and the deepest
truth—the type of great thought and sickly fancies—the
arm of clay, wrestling with and holding down the angel.
He looks at the skull, as though death had written on it
the history of man. In the distance one white arm is
seen above the tide, clutching at the branches of a willow
“growing askant a brook.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Now there are sweet, fitful noises in the air: a shaggy
monster, his lips glued to a bottle—his eyes scarlet with
wine—wine throbbing in the very soles of his feet—heaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and rolls along, mocked at by a sparkling creature couched
in a cowslip’s bell.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now a maiden and a youth, an eternity of love in
their passionate looks, with death as a hooded priest joining
their hands: a gay gallant follows them, led on by Queen
Mab, twisting and sporting as a porker’s tail.</p>

<p class='c010'>The horns sound—all, all is sylvan! Philosophy in
hunter’s suit, stretched beneath an oak, moralises on a
wounded deer, festering, neglected, and alone: and now
the bells of folly jingle in the breeze, and the suit of motley
glances among the greenwood.</p>

<p class='c010'>The earth is blasted—the air seems full of spells: the
shadows of the Fates darken the march of the conqueror:
the hero is stabbed with air-drawn steel.</p>

<p class='c010'>The waves roar like lions round the cliff: the winds are
up, and howling; yet there is a voice, louder than theirs—a
voice made high and piercing by intensest agony!
The singer comes, his white head “crowned with rank
fumitor”—madness, tended by truth, speaking through
folly!</p>

<p class='c010'>The Adriatic basks in the sun: there is a street in
Venice; “a merry bargain” is struck—the Jew slinks like
a balked tiger from the court.</p>

<p class='c010'>Enter a pair of legs, marvellously cross-gartered.</p>

<p class='c010'>And hark! to a sound of piping, comes one with an ass’s
head wreathed with musk roses and a spirit playing around
it like a wildfire.</p>

<p class='c010'>A handkerchief, with “magic in the web,” comes like a
trail of light, and disappears.</p>

<p class='c010'>A leek—a leek of immortal green shoots up!</p>

<p class='c010'>Behold! like to the <i>San Trinidad</i>, swims in a buck-basket
labelled “to Datchet Meads.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There gleam two roses, red and white—a Roman cloak
stabbed through and through—a lantern of the watch of
Messina!</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>A thousand images of power and beauty pass along.</p>

<p class='c010'>The glorious pageant is over—no! fancy is yet at
work.—</p>

<p class='c010'>Yonder ship, laden with sherris, canary, and spice—see
how her masts and rigging fall and melt, like metal in a
furnace! Her huge hold, stowed to the deck with wine,
swells and distends, and takes another form. We see no
ship, but a man mountain, with a belly that “would sink a
navy.” One butt of red wine is sinking in the Thames:
no; it moves and shapes itself into something like a nose,
which, rising like a comet, fiery red, before him of the
abdomen, seems as ’twere purposed for a torch to light him
“’twixt tavern and tavern.” And see——</p>

<p class='c010'>But the day-dream of the youth is broken. A visitor,
mounted, has just arrived, and would fain enter the play-house;
but there is none bold or strong enough to hold his
steed. At least a dozen men—it was remarkable that each
had in his bosom a roll of paper, it might be the draft
of a play—rushing from the Rose, strove to hold the bridle:
but some the horse trod down—some he struck paralytic
with his flashing eye—some ran away, half distraught at his
terrible neighing. At length our dreamer approached the
steed, which, as it had been suddenly turned to stone,
stood still. The rider dismounted and entered the play-house,
leaving his horse tended by our hero. The animal
ate from out his hand—answered with its proud head the
caresses of its feeder—and, as it pranced and curveted, a
sound of music, as from the horny hoofs of dancing satyrs,
rose from the earth. All stood amazed at the sudden
taming of the horse.</p>

<p class='c010'>The play ended—the audience issued from the doors.
The story had run from mouth to mouth, touching the
new-comer and his horse. All hurried about the stranger,
to see him mount. He, with some difficulty, such was the
crowd, leaped on his steed, when, inclining his face, radiant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>with smiles, towards the youth who had performed the
office of his groom, he flashed like a sunbeam out of
sight. All stood marble with astonishment. At length
the immortal quality of the visitor was made manifest, for,
in the press and hurry, a feather had fallen from one of his
wings—albeit, concealed and guarded by a long cloak.</p>

<p class='c010'>The youth who had taken charge of the horse seized, as
his rightful wages, on this relic of Phœbus, and, taking his
way, he fashioned it into a pen, and with it from time to
time gave to the “airy nothings” of his day-dream “a
local habitation and a name.”</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c010'>It is modestly hoped that this well-authenticated story
will wholly silence the sceptical objections of Mr Steevens.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>THE EPITAPH OF SIR HUGH EVANS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'>“<span class='sc'>There’s</span> pippins and cheese to come!”</p>
<p class='c010'>Such are the hopeful words of an old divine—of one Sir
Hugh Evans—a preacher distinguished in the latter part of
the reign of Henry the Fourth, not so much for the ascetic
asperity of his speech and bearing as for a certain household
wisdom that ran like threads of gold through his most
familiar sentences, enhanced and recommended by a blithe
look and a chirping voice; all of which excellent gifts made
him the oracle and friend of the yeomen and goodwives of
Windsor. These inestimable qualities—to say nothing of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>his miraculous hand at bowls, and his marvellous sagacity
as a brewer of sack—had, as we have already inferred,
endeared him to his flock: and, living, and preaching, and
gossiping in a neighbourhood of love and good fellowship,
the parson grew old, his cheek mellowing to the last; when,
in the year——, he fell, like an over-ripe plum from the
tree, into his grave—all the singing men and maids and little
children of mournful Windsor following their teacher to his
couch of earth, and chanting around it the hymn best loved
by him when living.</p>

<p class='c010'>In sooth, the funeral of the poor knight was most bravely
attended. Six stout morrice-men carried the corpse from
a cottage, the property of the burly, roystering Host of the
“Garter”—a pretty rustic nook, near Datchet Meads,
whither the worn-out parson had, for six months before his
death, retired from the stir and bustle of Windsor—and
where, on a summer evening, he might be seen seated in the
porch, patiently hearing little John Fenton lisp his Berkshire
Latin,—the said John being the youngest grandson of old
Master Page, and godchild of the grey-headed, big-bellied
landlord of the “Garter.” Poor Sir Hugh had long been
afflicted with a vexing asthma; and, though in his gayer
times he would still brew sack for younger revellers, telling
them rare tales of “poor dear Sir John and the Prince,”
he had, for seven years before his death, eschewed his
former sports, and was never known to hear of a match
of bowls that he did not shake his head and sigh,—and
then, like a stout-hearted Christian as he was, soothe his
discomfited spirit with the snatch of an old song. Doctor
Caius had, on his death-bed, bequeathed to Sir Hugh an
inestimable treasure; nothing less than a prescription—a
very charm—to take away a winter cough: for three years
had it been to Sir Hugh as the best gift of King Oberon;
but the fourth winter the amulet cast its virtue, and from
year to year the parson grew worse and worse,—when, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>the sixty-eighth year of his age, on a bright May morning, in
the arms of his gossip and friend, staid, sober Master Slender,
with the Host of the “Garter” seated (for he was too fat
to stand) in an arm-chair at the bedside, and Master Page and
Master Ford at the foot, Sir Hugh Evans, knight and priest,
passed into death, as into a sweet, sound sleep. His wits
had wandered somewhat during the night,—for he talked of
“Herne the hunter” and “a boy in white”; and then he
tried to chirrup a song,—and Masters Page and Ford
smiled sadly in each other’s face as the dying man, chuckling
as he carolled, trolled forth—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Till candles, and starlight, and moonshine be out.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>As the day advanced, the dying man became more calm;
and at length, conscious of his state, he passed away at
half-past nine in the morning, with a look of serenest happiness—and
“God be with you!” were the last words that
fluttered from his lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>The personal property of the dead parson was shared
among his friends and servants. Master Slender inherited
his “Book of Songs and Posies”; the Host of the “Garter”
the sword with which Sir Hugh had dared Doctor Caius to
mortal combat; and all his wardrobe, consisting of two
entire suits and four shirts, somewhat softened the grief of
Francis Simple—son of Simple, former retainer of Master
Slender, and for three years body-servant of dead Sir Hugh.
A sum of two shillings and fourpence, discovered among the
effects of the deceased, was faithfully distributed to the
parish poor.</p>

<p>“One ... who would have added weight and dignity to the ceremony”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c009'>There was sadness in Windsor streets as the funeral procession
moved slowly towards the church. Old men and
women talked of the frolics of Sir Hugh; and though they
said he had been in his day something of the merriest for a
parson, yet more than one gossip declared it to be her belief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>that “worse men had been made bishops.” A long train
of friends and old acquaintance followed the body. First,
came worthy Master Slender—chief mourner. He was a
bachelor, a little past his prime of life, with a sad and sober
brow, and a belly inclining to portliness. The severe censors
of Windsor had called him woman-hater, for that in his
songs and in his speech he would bear too hardly on the
frailties and fickleness of the delicate sex; for which unjust
severity older people might perchance, and they would, have
found some small apology. For, in truth, Master Slender
was a man of softest heart; and though he studiously avoided
the company of women, he was the friend of all the children
of Datchet and Windsor. He always carried apples in his
pocket for little John Fenton, youngest child of Anne
Fenton, formerly Anne Page; and was once found sitting
in Windsor Park, with little John upon his knees,—Master
Slender crying like a chidden maid. Of this enough. Let
it now suffice to say that Master Slender—for the Host
was too heavy to walk—was chief mourner. Then followed
Ford and his wife; next, Mr Page and his son William,—poor
Mrs Page being dead two years at Christmas, from a
cold caught with over dancing, and then obstinately walking
through the snow from her old gossip Ford’s. Next in the
procession were Master Fenton and his wife, and then
followed their eight children in couples; then Robin—now
a prosperous vintner, once page to Sir John,—with Francis
Simple; and then a score of little ones, to whom the poor
dead parson would give teaching in reading and writing,—and,
where he marked an apter wit among his free disciples,
something of the Latin accidence. These were all that
followed Sir Hugh Evans to his rest—for death had thinned
the thick file of his old acquaintance. One was wanting,
who would have added weight and dignity to the ceremony—who,
had he not some few years before been called to
fill the widest grave that was ever dug for flesh, would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>have cast from his broad and valiant face a lustrous sorrow
on the manes of the dead churchman,—who would have
wept tears, rich as wine, upon the coffin of his old friend; for
to him, in the convenient greatness of his heart, all men,
from the prince of the blood to the nimming knave who
stole the “handle of Mrs Bridget’s fan,” were, by turns,
friends and good fellows; who, at the supper at the
“Garter” (for the Host gave a solemn feast in celebration
of the mournful event), would have moralised on death and
mortal accidents, and, between his tankards, talked fine
philosophy—true divinity; would have caroused to the
memory of the dead in the most religious spirit of sack,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>and have sent round whole flagons of surest consolation.
Alas! this great, this seeming invincible spirit, this mighty
wit, with jests all but rich enough to laugh Death from his
purpose—to put him civilly aside with a quip, bidding him
to pass on and strike at leaner bosoms,—he himself, though
with “three fingers on the ribs,” had been hit; and he, who
seemed made to live for ever, an embodied principle of
fleshly enjoyment,—he, the great Sir John—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“He was dead and nailèd in his chest.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Others, too, passed away with their great dominator, were
wanting at the ceremonial. Where was he, with nose
enshrining jests richer to us than rubies? Truly liberal, yet
most unfortunate spirit, hapless Bardolph; where, when Sir
Hugh was laid upon the lap of his mother earth, oh! where
wert thou? Where was that glorious feature that, had the
burying been at the dead time of night, would have outshone
the torches? Where was that all-rich—all-lovely
nose? Alack! it may be in the maws of French falcons;
its luckless owner throttled on the plains of Agincourt for
almost the smallest theft; hung up by fellest order of the
Fifth Henry—of his old boon companion, his brother robber
on the field of Gadshill. And could Harry march from the
plain with laurel on his brow and leave the comrade of his
youth—his fellow-footpad—with neck mortally cut “with
edge of penny cord”? Should such a chaplet have been
intertwined with such hemp? The death of Bardolph is a
blot—a foul, foul blot on the ’scutcheon of Agincourt. But
let us pass the ingratitude and tyranny of kings, to dwell
wholly upon the burial of Sir Hugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>Who shall say that all the spirits with whom the parson
was wont to recreate himself,—to counsel, to quarrel,—who
shall say that they did not all mingle in the procession, all
once again pass through the streets of ancient Windsor?
The broad shadow of Sir John, arm-in-arm with the spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>of Mrs Page,—Bardolph and Nym, descended from their
gibbets, new from the plains of France, to make melancholy
holiday in Berkshire,—learned Dr Caius, babbling Quickly,
and Pistol, her broken, war-worn husband, kicked down the
tavern stairs, where in his old days he served as drawer, and
was killed,—and Shallow, immortal Shallow, his lean ghost
fluttering with a sense of office,—who shall say that all these
did not crowd about the coffin of good Sir Hugh, and, as
he was laid in the grave, give him a smiling welcome to his
everlasting habitation? Let us not, in this day of light, be
charged with superstition, if in these pages—perpetual as
adamant—we register our belief, a belief mingling in our very
blood, that all these illustrious ghosts followed, and, with their
dim majesty, ennobled the procession,—albeit, to the eyes of
the uninitiate, none but the living did service to the dead.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sir Hugh Evans was laid by the side of his old friend
and old antagonist, Doctor Caius; and, for many years,
there was a story among the good wives of Windsor, that
the fairies, once a year, danced round the grave of Sir Hugh,
the turf upon it growing as bright as emeralds; and, in a
hawthorn bush, but a few paces from the spot, “melodious
birds” did, at certain seasons, “sing madrigals.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We have now to speak of the epitaph of the good Sir
Hugh. More than four hundred years have passed away
since the mortal part of that most worthy piece of Welsh
divinity was consigned to dust. It may be a lesson to
ambition to learn that the exact spot where he was buried
cannot, at the present time, be verified: the ablest antiquarians
are at odds about it. Proud, however,—and, we
trust, not unbecomingly so,—are we to be the means of
publishing to the world the epitaph of Sir Hugh, copied
from his tombstone, in the possession of a gentleman in
Berkshire, who has resisted our most earnest supplications
that he would suffer us to make known his name. This
favour he has resolutely refused; but has, in the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>handsome manner, presented us with the use of the tombstone,
together with a most voluminous, and no less satisfactory,
account of its genuineness. Happy should we
have been could we have found room for the history of
the relic at full. Leaving it, however, for the archives of
the Antiquarian Society, we must content ourselves with
stating that the document fully proves that the tombstone
was erected from the private munificence of Master Slender,
and that the pithy and most touching epitaph inscribed
upon it was selected by his happy taste, as combining all
the excellences of an epitaph in the fewest words—these
words having the further recommendation of being uttered,
on a memorable occasion, by the deceased himself. The
words were repeated to Master Slender by his servant
Simple, despatched, on a certain day, by Sir Hugh with a
letter touching the wooing of Anne Page. After long
pondering, reviewing every circumstance of his ancient
friendship with the dead Sir Hugh,—seated, one sunny
afternoon, on the bench outside the “Garter,” the words
came jump again into the mind of Slender; and quickly
raising and emptying his tankard, he marched, like a man
resolved, to the stone-cutter, and—for he cared not for
Latin—bade the workman cut on the stone—(the inscription,
considering its age, is in a wonderful state of preservation)—the
words that follow:—</p>

baneful snake rustles among the grass, where no blight

They are scattered throughout every country of the world,
their moral likeness to their sage ancestor becoming stronger
in the land of wealth and luxury. They are a race marked
and distinguished by the characteristics of their first parent—omnivorous
selfishness and invulnerable self-complacency.
They wear the ass’s head, yet know it not; and heedless
of the devotion, have the Titania fortune still to round their
temples “with coronets of fresh and fragrant flowers.”
They sleep to the watching of an enamoured fairy, and
wake only to new experiences of her tenderness and beauty.</p>

      <div class='line in1'>Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Have we not here the adjuration of the fairy fortune to
all her ministering delights and pleasures of the world, to
render service and to do homage to the dull-brained creature
of her passion? Extract the poetry, the delicious fancy,
from the injunction of the Queen of Fairies, and what is it
but the command of worldly luck to her many servitors, to
seek all imaginable delights for the sordid lump of earth,
the mere animal with an “ass’s head” her diseased and
wayward affections have made an idol of? Is not the
world thronged with these Bottoms? In shape, in
lineament, in every moral feature, are they not the veritable
descendants of the swaggering homespun Athenian? They
are the very nurslings of fortune, the monstrous and uncouth
objects of her blind and fickle passion; yet do they
submit to her endearments with no distrust, no passing
suspicion of their own worthiness. They receive her
blandishments as nothing more than a just and rightful
reward for excellence. They cannot conceive how it
could have been otherwise. Their imagination, vassal to
their self-complacency, will not allow them to change
places for an instant with their less prosperous fellow. No;
Fortune dotes upon them, and how can she help it? Her extravagant
fondness is not excused, but justified, made inevitable
by the excelling worthiness of their parts. Hence, with
what serenity they issue mandates to the retainers of their
fond mistress—with what lordly self-conviction of their
own merits they accept their service! How they order
Cobweb, Peaseblossom, and Mustardseed to do their fantastic
bidding, as though their bondmaster, created with natural
and inalienable right to their feudality. Nothing in the way
of greatness surprises them—no flattery startles them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful!” cries Titania
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>to her ass-headed lover, and he by no syllable disclaims the
truth, the justice of the eulogy. He swallows the praise
as his natural food, takes the sweet sound of his doting
goddess as rightful, every-day applause. He is loved by a
goddess, for the goddess—we have said it—cannot help it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The insensibility of the sons of Bottom is one of their
grand, their unerring characteristics. It is this profitable
faculty that would make them task the daintiest spirits for
their own poorest, vilest wants, and dream of nothing
monstrous or extravagant in such application.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master
Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Scratch my head, Peaseblossom.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Monsieur Cobweb; good mounsieur, get you your
weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped bumble-bee
on the top of a thistle; and, good mounsieur, bring me
the honey-bag.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus spoke the great progenitor, Bottom; and of a
verity his children are not more shame-faced task-masters.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next, let us contrast the power and beauty of delights
placed by Queen Titania at his will, with the mean, the
sordid wretchedness of Bottom’s appetite and tastes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Tit.</i> What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Bot.</i> I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let’s
have the tongs and bones.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Tit.</i> Or say, sweet love, what thou desir’st to eat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Bot.</i> Truly a peck of provender: I could munch your
good dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle
of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Tit.</i> I have a venturous fairy that shall seek<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squirrel’s hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Bot.</i> I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I have an
exposition of sleep come upon me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Tit.</i> Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.<br />
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairies, be gone, and be always away.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently entwist; the female ivy so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Oh, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!</i>”</p>

<p class='c010'>Is this a scene of mere fairy-land? No; but a thing of
hard, every-day prosaic life. Have we not about us the
children, the thick-headed descendants of Bottom, with the
Titania fortune tempting them to the enjoyments of the
rarest and sweetest delights? and yet the coarse animal
craving of</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>make answer to her dainty invitations with the poorest,
coarsest desires! A goddess bids them choose music, and
they are for nothing but “tongs and bones.” Fortune
prays them to the banquet on immortal food, and, with asinine
stubbornness, they bray for “a handful or two of dried
peas.” They are warbled to by a goddess, and, unconscious
of the homage, they make answer with the sense of an ass.
We ask it, did Bottom die childless?</p>
<p class='c010'>Bottom’s babes flourish in twenty paths of life. We
meet his children in the stock-market; we see them sleek
and smug behind the counter; we catch their faces through
carriage windows; we hear their tuneful voices from the
county-bench, the city-court, yea, in nobler convocations
still. Sometimes, too, like their Athenian father, they are
“translated.” No matter for the difference of calling, the
influence of education, there is the family face—the family
voice; the expression of self-blessed insensibility, the note
of self-complacent gratulation. Throughout the life-teeming
page of Shakespeare there is not a finer poetic rendering
of a commonplace, vulgar class than Bottom.</p>

<p class='c010'>The very heart of their mystery beats in the bosom of
the weaver. His eagerness to be all things, from an assured
conviction of his fitness for everything, is only their daily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>conceit dramatically developed. In that brief scene, what
a picture have we, what a history of the ten thousand incidents
of prose life! What an exhibition of the profound
busy-bodies who clamorously desire to be Wall, Lion,
Moonshine, and Pyramus too, not from an acquired belief, but
as it would seem from a natural instinct of their own fitness
for the combined charges! How triumphantly does Bottom
swagger down his fellows! How small, mean, degenerate—what
nobodies are they, before that giant conceit, the
thick-skulled weaver!<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c017'><sup>[3]</sup></a> And in all this there is nothing
that is not the severest transcript of human life. We laugh
at it; and the next moment we are touched into gravity by
a reflection of its serious meaning—its philosophic comments
on the vulgar pretence of the every-day world.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f3'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is impossible, we think, for the reader, if he witnessed <i>A
Midsummer Night’s Dream</i> at Covent Garden last season (1840) to
banish from his memory the <i>Flute</i> of Keeley in this scene. How
meekly, how resignedly he gave place to the burly consequence
of <i>Bottom</i>. It was not imbecility, but a mute absorbing sense of
homage to the greatness of the weaver, one of those subtle touches
that show the sympathy of the actor with the profoundest meanings
of the poet.</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The finer part of the picture, in which as we receive it,
Shakespeare, with immortal tints, has shadowed forth the
souls of a herd of men, is Bottom doted upon by the Queen
of Fairies. It is here we have the true lineaments of a
vulgar nature emblazoned by luck. It is here we recognise
the self-sufficient creature of worldly success—the ignorant
bashaw of life wearing his bravery as an ordained and
necessary part of himself. He has the riches, the sweets
of the earth, at his command, and he pauses not in passing
wonder at his prosperity. To him there is no such power
as a Providence. It is a part of the world’s destiny that
he should be precisely what he is; he is the begotten of
fate, and owes no obligation to vulgar fortune.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor are Bottom’s Babes less like their putative sire, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>they have suffered no transformation. There are those who
come into the world with the ass’s head, and live and die
wound in the arms of doting wealth. The hard task-masters
of life are often of these. The foolish, arrogant censors of
the faults and backslippings of penury are to be found
among them—the full fleshed moralists who shake their
shaggy ears at the small delinquencies of struggling men.
They eat, drink, sport, and sleep in fairyland; their lightest
wish evokes a minister to do their bidding; and in their
most fantastic, foolish moods, still Fortune—weak, besotted
quean!—cries, with silverest voice:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, how I love ye! How I dote on ye!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bottom as we opine, considered in his truthfulness, in his
reflective powers of worldly semblance, awakens our pensiveness,
not our mirth. We think of the thousands of his
children, and the smile that would break at the mere words
of the weaver, is chequered by the thought of his prosaic
offspring. Yes; his offspring. It matters not that you
point to—in his carriage, that you run through his accredited
genealogy, that you show his armorial bearings. We answer—if
he receive the goods of fortune as his <i>right</i>, with no
thankfulness for the gifts, no gratitude displayed by constant
sympathy with the wants and weaknesses of suffering man,
though you call him marquis, we say he is the Babe of
Bottom; and for his quarterings, though they date from
the Conquest, the eye of our philosophy sees nought on his
carriage panels but an ass’s head in a field, proper; and in
the motto reads—“A bottle of hay!”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>SHAKESPEARE IN CHINA</h2>
</div>
<p class='c023'>“I cannot tell that the wisest Mandarin now living in China
is not indebted for part of his energy and sagacity to Shakespeare
and Milton, even though it should happen that he never heard of
their names.”</p>
<div class='c024'>—Godwin’s <i>Essay on Sepulchres</i>.</div>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>We</span> do great injustice to the College of Mandarins, if we
think that body at the present time ignorant of the marvels
of Shakespeare. No: Canton has produced its commentator,
and, by means of his explanatory genius, it is hoped
that in a few years the whole Celestial Empire will, in the
fulness of its knowledge, bow to the majesty of the poet.
At this moment we have before us a radiant evidence of
the admission of the great teacher into the Sacred City:
believe it, astounded reader, Shakespeare has gone farther
than Nieuhoff. England, however—that England who has
shown herself such an idolatress of her darling son—who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>has encircled the house in which he first drew breath with
a golden rail—who has secured it from possible destruction
at the hands of the bigot, by making it the property of the
State—that England who, when the tree planted by the
bard was felled by the axe, wept as she turned the timber
into ’bacco-stoppers<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c017'><sup>[4]</sup></a>—that England who, even at the
present time, only a little more than two centuries after his
death, has already begun to think of the propriety of
erecting, at some future day, a national monument to her
poet—that England cannot, after the many and affecting
instances of her deep and maternal love towards her most
illustrious child, refuse to aid in the dissemination of
Shakespearanity in any corner of the world, but at the
present interesting crisis, more particularly in the empire
of China.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cry that the Chinese are not yet fit for Shakespeare—a
cry raised in the same acute spirit in which people in
chains have been said not to be fit for freedom—can, we
think, have no bad effect on even moderately liberal men,
after the production of papers now beneath our hands. All
we ask of the Foreign Minister is a company, to act either
on board Chinese junks or on shore, as the intellectual
wants of his Majesty may require; nay, if under the direction
of their own stage-manager, to exhibit themselves at
any distance in the interior. The company to be paid and
clothed by the government for whose benefit they act, with
this condition, that they be subject to the laws and customs
of the Chinese, obediently shaving their eyebrows and
letting their tails grow. For the passing difficulty of the
language, that, we have no doubt, will soon be overcome;
many of the actors, we religiously believe it, speaking and
playing equally well in English or in Chinese. We now
come to the proofs of the fit condition of the people for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Shakespeare—for that which they will “hail as a boon,”
and which we shall part with as a drug.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some months since, it was our fortune to be present
at an auction of curiosities from the East—shells, parrots,
rice-paper, chop-sticks, japanned cabinets, and cut-throat
sparrows. Our friend Peregrine—he had just arrived from
the Great Pyramid, from the top of which, and by means of a
most excellent glass, he had discovered, and afterwards made
captive, three giraffes—bade money for a picture. As it was
a scene from Shakespeare, there were of course no opposing
bidders, and he became the owner of what proved to be an
exquisite evidence of Chinese art and imitation; in brief,
no other than a copy faithfully drawn, and most brilliantly
coloured by an artist at Canton of the Boydell picture of
Falstaff in the Buck-basket, and the Merry Wives. The
picture, however, proved in itself to be of little value compared
to the essay found to be inserted at the back between
the picture and the frame; being written on paper, half a
quire of which would not exceed the thickness of a butterfly’s
wing, it is no wonder that the treasure escaped even the
meritorious vigilance of an auctioneer. It is this essay that
we now propose to submit to the reader, in evidence of the
condition of China for an instant export of a company of
fine Shakespearian actors. When we state that the essay has
been printed by its author in at least one of the Canton
journals, the dissemination and adoption of the principles
comprised in it, over the whole of China, cannot for half a
moment be a matter of doubt.</p>

<p class='c010'>We regret that we cannot wholly acquit our intelligent
Mandarin of the taint of ingratitude. It is evident that his
views of English history—at least of that portion in which
Falstaff conspicuously appears, for the writer suffers no
subject to escape in any way involved in the character of
the immortal knight—have been gathered from one of our
fellow countrymen; he has, if we may be allowed to say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>it, sucked the brain, as a “weasel sucks eggs,” of some
enlightened but obscure supercargo whom he has left unhonoured
and unthanked. How different, in a similar case,
was the conduct of an Englishman: our deep veneration of
the national character will not, at this happy moment, suffer
us to be silent on the grateful magnanimity of Mr Nahum
Tate, who, in his preface to his improved version of <i>King
Lear</i>, returns his “thanks to an <i>ingenious friend</i> who first
pointed out the tragedy” to his condescending notice!
The silence of the Mandarin towards his instructor is the
more strange, as ingratitude is not the vice of the barbarian.
An ingenious friend points out a skulking, unarmed straggler
to a Cossack; the soldier makes him prisoner, cuts off his
ears, slits his nose, bores his tongue, and having mounted the
captive behind him, in the cordial spirit of Nahum Tate,
“thanks his ingenious friend” for his information! But it
is so; in this particular our mandarin fails in comparison
with the Cossack and with Nahum Tate.</p>

<p class='c010'>We now lay before the reader the Essay of Ching the
Mandarin, who, it will be seen, in his orders to the painter
employed to copy the original picture—by whom taken to
China remains unknown—has, with national exactness, given
the birth and education not only of the author of Falstaff,
but of Falstaff himself, together with glancing notices of—Windsor
wives and Windsor soap.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is, perhaps, only due to the translator, to state that by
our express solicitation he has a little lowered the orientalism
of the original, whilst he has at the same time endeavoured
to preserve the easy, conversational tone of the educated
Chinese.</p>

    <div><span class='c025'>“CHING TO TING.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“I send, O Ting, from the barbarian ship, a picture of
barbarians. Make one for your friend, like unto it; in
size, in shape, and colour, even the same. But why should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>I waste words with Ting, whose pencil is true as the tongue
of Confutzee? No; I will straightway deliver to him all
my studies have made known to me of the barbarians written
on the canvas before him: for how can even Ting paint the
faces of barbarians in their very truth, if he knows not the
history not only of themselves but of their fathers?</p>

<p class='c010'>“The he barbarian with the big belly was called Forlstoff,
and in time was known as Surgeon Forlstoff: from which,
there is no doubt, he was a skilful leech in the army of the
barbarian king, more of whom in good season. Forlstoff’s
father was one Shak or Shake, Speare or Spear; for there
have been great tumults among the barbarians about the e.
In nothing does the ignorance of the English barbarians
more lamentably discover itself than in the origin they
obstinately give to their Shakespeare; who, according to
them, was, like the great Brahme, hatched in an egg on the
bank of a river, as may be seen in a thousand idle books in
which he is called the ‘Swan of Haveone.’ And this conceit
was further manifested in the building of a place called
‘the Swan Theatre,’ where the barbarians were wont to
worship. There is little known of Shakespeare’s wife, Forlstoff’s
mother, and that little proves her to have been an
idle person, given to great sleep and sloth, as is shown by
her getting nothing at the death of her husband but his
‘second-best bed!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“If Forlstoff would not, at a later time of life, leave off
stealing, there is little doubt that he owed the fault to his
father, Shakespeare, who was forced to fly to London,
which is a sacred city for all thieves, for having stolen an
antelope, an animal consecrated to the higher kinds of
barbarians, and which it is death for the poor to touch.
Indeed, the flesh of the antelope is to be eaten with safety
by very few of the barbarians, it having killed even many of
the Eldermen immediately after dinner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When Shakespeare came to London he was poor and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>without friends, and he held the horses of the rich
barbarians who came to worship at a temple on the banks
of the river. In time he learned to make shoes for the
horses; and in such esteem are the shoes still held by the
barbarians, that they are bought at any price, and nailed at
the threshold of their houses and barns; for where they
are nailed, the foolish natives think no fire, no pestilence
will come, and no evil thing have any strength. Such is
the silly idolatry of the barbarians.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At length Shakespeare got admitted into the temple;
and there he showed himself master of the greatest arts;
and he wrote charms upon paper which, it is said, will
make a man weep or laugh with very happiness,—will bring
spirits from the sky and devils from the water,—will open
the heart of a man and show what creeps within it,—will
now snatch a crown from a king, and now put wings to the
back of a beggar. And all this they say Shakespeare did,
and studied not. No, beloved Ting, he was not like Sing,
who, though but a poor cowherd, became wise by poring
on his book spread between the horns of his cow, he
travelling on her back.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And Shakespeare proceeded in his marvels, and he
became rich; and even the queen of the barbarians was
seen to smile at him, and once, with a burning look, to
throw her glove at him; but Shakespeare, it is said, to the
discomfiture of the queen, returned the glove, taking no
further notice of the amatory invitation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In a ripe season of his life Shakespeare gave up conjuring,
and returned to the village on the banks of the river
Haveone, where, as it is ignorantly believed, he was hatched,
and where he lived in the fulness of fortune. He had laid
down his conjuring-rod and taken off his gown, and passed
for nothing more than a man, and, it is said—though you,
beloved Ting, who see the haughty eyes and curling noses
of the lesser man mandarins, can, after what I have writ of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Shakespeare, hardly believe it—thought himself nothing
more.</p>
<div id='i034'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i034.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“Became wise by poring on his book”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c009'>“Shakespeare built himself a house and planted a tree.
The house is gone, but the barbarians preserve bricks of it
in their inner chambers, even—I tremble as I pen it—as
we preserve the altars of our gods.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The tree was cut down by a fakir in a brain fever, but
the wood is still worshipped. And this, O Ting! I would
not ask you to believe had not your own eyes witnessed
that wonderful tree,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c017'><sup>[5]</sup></a> the leaves whereof, falling to the
ground, become mice! Hence learn that the leaves of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Shakespeare’s mulberry have become men, and on a
certain day every year, with mulberry boughs about their
heads, their bodies clothed in their richest garments, they
chant praises to the memory of Shakespeare, and drink
wine to his name.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f5'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See Navarrete’s <i>China</i> for the account of this tree; underneath
which, we humbly suggest, it would be as well to keep a cat.</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Shakespeare—Forlstoff’s father, and the father of a
hundred lusty sons and daughters, such as until that time
had never been born, Shakespeare—died! He was buried
in a chest of cedar, set about with plates of gold. On one
of these plates was writ some magic words; for thieves,
breaking into the grave, were fixed and changed to stone;
and are now to be seen even as they were first struck by the
charm of the magician. And so much, beloved Ting, of
Shakespeare, Forlstoff’s father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>That our Mandarin has herein displayed very popular
abilities for the difficult task of a commentator, no one
who has read many volumes of Shakespearian commentaries
will, we believe, deny. It is observable that in many
instances he makes his facts; a custom of particular
advantage to the indulgence of the most peculiar opinions
and conclusions. We have read some writers who, deprived
of this privilege, would really have nothing to work upon.
The pleasure of making a giant, great as it possibly may
be, cannot be comparable to the delight of killing him,
our own handiwork. If, however, our reader will bear with
us, we will proceed with the labours of Ching on the
character of Falstaff, and on those personages and events,
directly and indirectly, associated with his glorious name.
Falstaff in China! Jack Falstaff on a regimen of rice!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Forlstoff was born in the third hour of the morning;
and at his birth the roundness of his belly and the whiteness
of his head betokened his future greatness. But little
is known of his early life; save that he assisted in the
temples of the barbarians, where his voice, once remarkable
for its sweetness, became broken with the zeal of the singer.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>He then travelled with a juggler, and—if lying were not the
especial vice of the barbarians—did greater wonders than
even our own Yiyi. The Eldermen of London—so named
because chosen from the oldest inhabitants—are known by
a ring upon the thumb; this ring Forlstoff, to the admiration
of the barbarian court, crept through and through like
any worm, and was promoted by the king therefore. I
should, however, do evil unto truth did I not advise you,
O Ting, that this feat of Forlstoff seems greater than
it really is: for a tame eagle being kept at the court of
the king, it was afterwards discovered that a talon of
the bird was something thicker than the waist of the said
Forlstoff.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is certain that Forlstoff, a short time after his feat
with the ring, became a student in a place called Clemency
Inn; which, as its name implies, is a temple wherein
youths study to become meek and merciful, to love all men
as brothers of their own flesh, and to despise the allurements
of wealth. There was with him another student, called
Robert Shaller, who afterwards became a mandarin, or, in
the barbarian tongue, a justice of the peace, being promoted
to that office because he was like a double radish, and
had his head carved with a knife. He was, when at
Clemency Inn, dressed in an eel-skin, and used to sleep
in a lute-case. He lent Forlstoff what the barbarians
call a thousand pounds, which Forlstoff was honest enough
to—acknowledge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I next find Forlstoff in company with one Princeal,
the son of the barbarian king, and several thieves. Forlstoff—and
here the vice of his father, Shakespeare, breaks
out in the child—tempts the king’s son to turn robber.
He is, however, so ashamed of the wickedness, that he
goes about it with a mask on his face, as a king’s son
ought.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Forlstoff falls into disgrace with Princeal, and is sent by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>him with soldiers to Coventry; that being a place in the
barbarian country where no man speaks to his neighbour.
After some delay Forlstoff marches through Coventry to
fight one Pursy, who can ride up a straight hill, and is
therefore called Hotspur. Forlstoff fights with him by—that
is, near a clock, and kills him, Princeal, the king’s
son, meanly endeavouring to deprive Forlstoff of the
honour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“After the battle Forlstoff goes to dine with the king at
Wincer, which is the royal manufactory for soap. Forlstoff
pretends to love two wives at the same time, and is put by
them in what is called by the barbarians a <i>buck</i>-basket—that
is a basket for the finer sort of barbarians, their word
<i>buck</i> answering to our <i>push</i>, and meaning high, handsome,
grand. He is flung into the river, and saves himself by
swimming to a garter. He is afterwards punished by being
turned into the royal forest, with horns upon his head and
chains upon his hands. Princeal, in time, becomes king,
and discards Forlstoff, who goes home—goes to bed—does
nothing but look at the ends of his fingers, talks of the
green fields about Wincer, and dies.</p>

<p class='c010'>“For the habits of Forlstoff, if they were not quite as
virtuous as those of Fo, it was perhaps the fault of his
times; for we have his own words to prove that they were
once those of the best barbarians. He swore but few oaths—gambled
but once a day—paid his debts four times—and
took recreation only when he cared for it. He loved
sack—a liquor that has puzzled the heads of the learned—without
eggs, and was extraordinarily temperate in
bread.</p>

<p class='c010'>“His companions were thieves of the highest repute—but
all, unhappily, died and left no sons!</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will now, oh wise and virtuous Ting, directed by
these few and feeble words, paint me the picture of Forlstoff
and his two wives.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>We put it to the impartial reader whether Ching, in
the above estimate of the character of Falstaff, has not
entitled himself to take rank with many Shakespearian
commentators; and whether, if the Foreign Minister will
not consent to ship a company of English actors to Canton,
Ching should not be invited by the patrons of the British
drama to preside in a London theatre.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>SOLOMON’S APE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c023'>“For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy
of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish,
bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.”—<i>Kings.</i></p>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>A learned</span> rabbi, Ben Eli, had filled three thick MS.
folios with the adventures of a certain ape, a sojourner at
the court of the wisest of kings. Though the work has
hitherto been withheld from the world, it seems not unlikely
that it has long been the acknowledged model of
many biographies. We conceive there is internal evidence
in the history of thousands of courtiers, that the writers
were aware how much the erudite Ben Eli could make of
an ape. They who have gravely registered the slightest
formality, the most evanescent word or gesture of certain
heroes, must have had in their memory the first chronicler
of monkey tricks. There was a time when it would have
been the simplest and safest course to publish the entire
folio: in former days, readers were like hogs, whose
master had the right of pannage: they were turned into
the literary forest to root, and grub up, and become as fat
as they might. Now, it is not enough to show them the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>tree of knowledge; but it is compulsory on those who
drive the “dreadful trade,” to clamber the branches, and
gather the fruit. Nay, and when gathered, the apple serves
not the epicure of our day, if it be not carefully pared and
sliced; and, in some instances, presented on a fork of
standard gold or silver. Moreover, cases have happened
wherein the quality of the fork hath been cavilled for, more
than that of the apple: thus, an embossed implement hath
at times passed off a sorry crab. Once it was enough for
wisdom to point out the wood where grew the nuts: now
must she gather and crack them.</p>
<p class='c010'>Thus much by way of feeble apology for the licence we
have taken with the folios of the venerable Ben Eli. We
have wandered through their forest of leaves; we have
picked all we could lay our hands upon; we have torn
away the husk—have broken the shell—and for the few
kernels—gentle feeder, some of them are before you.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the ape became a favourite with the servants of
Solomon. And the women smiled upon him, and the men
laughed at his grimace; and the ape was puffed with pride,
and became a proverb to the wise. And the ape forgot the
mother that bore him, and the father that begat him, and the
wood which, in the days of his youth, did give him shadow.
And—brief be the words—the ape forgot he was an ape.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There was a strange woman in the court of King Solomon.
She was beautiful as light; and many men did try for the love
of the strange woman; for she was a princess in her own
country.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And it fell, that the woman looked from her window,
and beheld in the court below the ape stretched, sleeping
in the sun: for it was high noon, and there was silence on
all things. But in the heart of the strange woman there
was no peace, for she thought of her father’s tents.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the ape awoke, and, looking upward, beheld the
strange woman. And there was vanity in his heart, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>he still looked upward. And the captive woman had compassion
on the creature, and, believing that he hungered,
cast him down a ripe pomegranate. And the ape did eat
the pomegranate, and did lick his lips, and did say in his
heart, ‘Of a truth, the strange woman doth love me.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the next day, at the same hour, the ape watched
under the window of the strange woman, and again she did
throw him fruit, which he did eat, and again did cry, ‘Nay,
it is certain she doth love me.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the same thing came to pass on the third and
fourth day.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And in the stillness of the fifth day, when sleep lay
upon the lids of the household, the ape did clamber the
wall which did shut in the strange woman. And as he
clomb, a voice still cried in his heart, ‘She doth love me.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the ape clambered up to the window of the
strange woman; and when she saw the monster, she filled
the chamber with her screams, and shrieked for help.
And the servants of the chamber came to her aid; and
the court was filled with a multitude.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the woman entreated to be saved from the ape;
but the ape understood not her words, for still he said to
himself, ‘She doth love me.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the men took staves, and did beat and bruise the ape,
but the ape was not convinced; for yet he said, ‘It is plain she
doth love me.’ And the ape fell wounded into the court beneath.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And when they inquired of the matter, the woman
said, ‘I thought the ape did hunger, and I took compassion
on his misery, and threw to him a pomegranate.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then a wise man said to the woman—‘Daughter, let
not beauty give gifts unto fools; for out of the kindness of
her heart do they misinterpret; and in the very offerings of
her compassion do they breed an ill report.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“And even as the wise man said these things, the ape
lay in the court beneath, and did lick his sore, and did blow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>the pouches of his cheeks, and cried, ‘It is manifest, the
strange woman doth love me.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“There were two jugglers in the train of the Queen of Sheba.
And they played, each with a serpent, before King Solomon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now the queen sought to prove the knowledge of the
king, and said,—‘Oh, Solomon, thou who hast spoken of
trees, from the cedar to the hyssop—also of beasts, and of
fowls, and of creeping things, and of fishes;</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Declare unto thy servant, which of the two is the true
serpent (for one was cunningly fashioned like unto a living
snake, and did move and writhe in the hands of the juggler);
for, of a truth, there is but one of the two that hath life.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the jugglers played with the snakes before the seat
of King Solomon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then the king did privily send for the ape; and when
he was brought in, the king caused him to be led near unto
the jugglers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the ape passed one of the men who played with
a snake, and took no note thereof; but as he approached
the fellow who held the second snake, the ape did shake,
and his hair did rise upon his skin, and he trembled exceedingly;
wherefore King Solomon discovered the true
snake, and all men praised the wisdom of the king.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c017'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>“Now the ape discovered that he had been made the judge
between the true and the false snake, and his head did swell
with the shouting, and he was puffed up with vain glory.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And after some days a multitude stood before the
judgment porch. And a strife had arisen between two
carvers—skilful workmen were they both.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Palm-trees, and open flowers, and every manner of
curious carving had they carved.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And they both claimed certain carvings of cherubim.
And when they had spoken and called their witnesses, King
Solomon paused to consider before he delivered judgment.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“It so chanced that the ape had crept among the multitude,
and had listened to the story of the carvers; and when he saw
the king pause, he said to himself, ‘Solomon is perplexed.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the ape brake through the multitude, and ran to the
porch, and did motion that he would judge between the carvers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the ape did leap upon the shoulders of the one,
and did caress him; but at the other he did scream, and
grind his teeth. And Solomon understood the folly of the
ape, and cried:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘It is ever so with the fool. Allow him the wisdom
that perceiveth and shunneth a serpent, and straightway he
will believe he hath understanding to judge even between
the cherubim.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>At present we must end our extracts from the pages of
Ben Eli; though we cannot close without appending the
final reflection of the learned rabbi, who, having narrated a
thousand other instances of the folly of the ape—how he
pilfered from the treasury, how he stole jewels to hang
about him, and how he plucked bare divers peacocks to
make himself a glory from their plumes, observes:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>An ape will ever be an ape, though compassed with gold,
and silver, and ivory, and though his dwelling-place be even the
court of King Solomon.</i>”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>THE CASTLE BUILDERS OF PADUA</h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Giulio</span> and Ippolito were sons of a farmer living near
Padua. The old man was of a quiet and placable temper,
rarely suffering any mischance to ruffle him, but, in the
firm and placid hope of the future, tranquillising himself
under the evil of the present. If blight came upon his corn
one year, he would say ’twere a rare thing to have blights in
two successive seasons; and so he would hope that the next
harvest, in its abundance, might more than compensate for
the scarcity of the last. Thus he lived from boyhood to
age, and retained in the features of the old man a something
of the lightness and vivacity of youth. His sons,
however, bore no resemblance to their father. Instead of
labouring on the farm they wasted their time in idly wishing
that fortune had made them, in lieu of healthy, honest sons
of a farmer, the children of some rich magnifico, that so they
might have passed their days in all the sports of the times,
in jousting, hunting, and in studying the fashions of brave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>apparel. They were of a humour at once impetuous and
sulky, and would either idly mope about the farm, or
violently abuse and ill-treat whomsoever accident might
throw in their way. The old man was inly grieved at the
wilfulness and disobedience of his sons, but, with his usual
disposition, hoped that time might remedy the evil; and so,
but rarely reproving them, they were left sole masters of
their hours and actions.</p>
<p class='c010'>One night, after supper, the brothers walked into the
garden to give loose to their idle fancies, always yearning
after matters visionary and improbable. It was a glorious
night, the moon was at the full, and myriads of stars glowed
in the deep blue firmament. The air stirred among the
trees and flowers, wafting abroad their sweetness; the dew
glittered on the leaves, and a deep-voiced nightingale,
perched in a citron tree, poured forth a torrent of song
upon the air. It was an hour for good thoughts and holy
aspirations. Giulio threw himself upon a bank, and, after
gazing with intentness at the sky, exclaimed:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would that I had fields ample as the heavens above
us!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would,” rejoined Ippolito, “I had as many sheep as
there are stars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And what,” asked Giulio, with a sarcastic smile, “would
your wisdom do with them?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Marry,” replied Ippolito, “I would pasture them in
your sageship’s fields.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What!” exclaimed Giulio, suddenly raising himself upon
his elbow, and looking with an eye of fire upon his brother;
“whether I would or not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Truly, ay,” said Ippolito, with a stubborn significance
of manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have a care,” cried Giulio, “have a care, Ippolito;
do not thwart me. Am I not your elder brother?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; and marry, what of that? Though you came first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>into the world, I trow you left some manhood for him who
followed after.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You do not mean to insist that, despite my will, despite
the determination of your elder brother, you will pasture
your sheep in my grounds?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In truth but I do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And that,” rejoined Giulio, his cheek flushing, and his
lip tremulous, “and that without fee or recompense?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Assuredly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Giulio leaped to his feet, and, dashing his clenched hand
against a tree, with a face full of passion, and in a voice made
terrible by rage, he screamed, rather than said, “By the
Blessed Virgin but you do not!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And by St Ursula and her eleven thousand virgins I
protest I will.” This was uttered by Ippolito in a tone of
banter and bravado that for a moment made the excited
frame of Giulio quiver from head to foot. He gazed at the
features of Ippolito, all drawn into a sneer, and for a
moment gnashed his teeth. He was hastily approaching
the scoffer, when, by an apparently strong effort, he arrested
himself, and, turning upon his heel, struck hastily down
another path, where he might be seen pacing with short,
quick steps, whilst Ippolito, leaning against a tree, carelessly
sang a few lines of a serenata. This indifference was too
much for Giulio; he stopped short, turned, and then rapidly
came up to Ippolito, and with a manner of attempted tranquillity,
said, “Ippolito, I do not wish to quarrel with you;
I am your elder brother; then give up the point.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not I,” replied Ippolito, with the same immovable
smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What, then, you are determined that your sheep shall,
in very despite of me, pasture in my fields?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They shall.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Villain!” raved Giulio; and ere the word was well
uttered he had dashed his clenched hand in his brother’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>face. Ippolito sprang like a wild beast at Giulio, and for a
moment they stood with a hand at each other’s throat, and
their eyes, in the words of the Psalmist, were “whetted”
on one another. They stood but to gain breath, then
grappled closer. Ippolito threw his brother to the earth,
huddling his knees upon him, furious blows were exchanged,
but scarce a sound was uttered, save at intervals a blasphemous
oath or a half-strangled groan. Giulio was completely
overpowered by the superior strength and cooler
temper of his brother; but, lying prostrate and conquered,
his hands pinioned to his breast, and Ippolito glaring at
him with malicious triumph, he cursed and spat at him.
Ippolito removed his hand from his brother’s throat, and
ere his pulse could beat, Giulio’s poniard was in his brother’s
heart. He gave a loud shriek, and fell a streaming corpse
upon his murderer. The father, roused by the sound, came
hurrying to the garden; Giulio, leaping from under the dead
body, rushed by the old man, who was all too speedily
bending over his murdered child. From that hour hope
and tranquillity forsook the father; he became a brain-sick,
querulous creature, and in a few months died almost an
idiot. Giulio joined a party of robbers, and, after a brief
but dark career of crime, was shot by the sbirri.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ye who would build castles in the air—who would slay
your hours with foolish and unprofitable longings—ponder
on the visionary fields, the ideal sheep of Giulio and
Ippolito.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>THE TAPESTRY WEAVER OF BEAUVAIS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>The</span> oldest people of Beauvais remembered Schatten the
tapestry weaver. Some vowed he was threescore, some a
hundred years old; and ever as the subject was touched
upon, Schatten would widen his huge mouth, and cry with
a low chuckle, “Ay, ay, a thousand—more or less. I shall
live to see wrinkles in the sun.” None knew from what
stock he sprang—from what land he came. Such questions
he would ever parry with some extravagance. “I was born
of felspar and quartz, and my home was the Hartz Mountains
when they were no bigger than mole-hills.” And
thus Schatten lived on. He saw the child rise into manhood—wed—become
a parent—a grey-headed man—a
corpse; and so with the child’s child, and yet no change
came upon Schatten. He stood, a flinty image gazing on
dying generations.</p>
<p class='c010'>A hovel in an obscure part of Beauvais was the dwelling
of the weaver. There was his tapestry loom; and there,
day after day, and night after night, would he work, at times
droning a song to cheer what seemed the monotony of
an eternal employment. Notwithstanding the inexplicable
mystery about the man, he was, on the whole, a favourite
with his fellow-townsmen. There was something so meek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>in his demeanour, so placid, so unassuming, and his speech
was so soft and gentle, that although his name had been
mingled in strange recitals, he had never been molested,
but, on the contrary, was generally considered a harmless,
well-meaning creature; one who, far from sneering at the
pleasures of youth, looked upon them with seeming satisfaction.
No one more frequently witnessed the bacchanal
revelries of the topers of Beauvais; for, though Schatten
was no drinker himself, he beheld with unaffected pleasure
the loose jollity of others. The like at feasts: although
he was temperate as a chameleon, he would most readily
carve huge collops for others. He seemed to hold in
peculiar admiration a purple, bloated face and swagging
paunch, though his own sharp visage was as yellow as
saffron, and his figure lank as a thread-paper. This urbanity
towards the failings of others was, it will be conceded,
the secret of his popularity. Though he himself abstained
from all animal indulgence, he not only did not gloomily
lecture on the lawlessness of appetite, but, on the contrary,
smiled on its achievements. This charity hath served many
besides old Schatten.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there was another circumstance that greatly assisted
the goodly reputation of the weaver: it was the character
of his many visitors and pupils. His hovel was the resort
of the loveliest girls—the most beautiful youths, not only of
the town of Beauvais, but from the great city itself—from
elegant, voluptuous Paris; for even at the period of which
we write it was distinguished for the refinement and luxuries
of life.</p>

<p class='c010'>Schatten, in his capacity of tapestry weaver, had pictures
of every variety of subject; and it was his good fortune that
those professors who excelled in the beautiful art seemed
by common consent to seek old Schatten, that he might
immortalise their radiant sketches in his still more exquisite
tapestry. There was no subject which painting could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>portray, no imagination which it could robe in life and
colour, that was not ready for the loom of Schatten. If a
battle were the theme, there might be seen contending
heroes, with stern rapture in their faces, glory about their
heads—their every limb glowing as with Mars’ own fire—their
swords like sunbeams, and the smoking blood more
like libations to purple Liber, than torrents in which the
human life gushed forth. Thus a battle woven by old
Schatten was a grand and glorious thing—each combatant
was an excited god; whilst the drained and pallid carcass—the
dreadful wounds, with jagged and gaping mouths—the
rigid muscle straining against death—the fixed and
stone-like eye, and clotted hair—all the gross, substantial
horrors of systematic slaughter, were thrown into the shade:
they were not to expose that common liar—Glory. If the
subject were beauty, there might be seen—as erst was chosen
by the antique master—one charm from twenty different
faces, making a miracle of perfection. All that was voluptuous
and entrancing shone in the dewy light of woman’s
eye; there was an eternal youth in her red lip, a tenderness
in her warm cheek: too pure for the earth, too exquisitely
fragile, she seemed of a sisterhood ’twixt humanity and
angels. The same masterly hand was displayed though
the subject was the banquet of the glutton—the supper
was still spread “in the Apollo.” The same power shown
in the golden heaps of the miser: the food, the wine,
seemed ambrosia and nectar, bestowing immortality on
the lip that tasted: the gold glittered like something
dropped from the skies, to be worn as amulets against
calamity.</p>

<p class='c010'>A man so potent in his handicraft as Schatten might have
surrounded himself with all the symbols of wealth; and,
had he been ambitious, have successfully contended for the
highest honours of citizenship. But, it was plain, he valued
gold as ashes; and for the trappings of state and place, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>most regal shows, the pomp and blazonry of kings, were
with him matter for a jest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Alack!” cried Michel Sous, a withered money-scrivener
of Beauvais—“I hear ’twas a brave sight; and plague on
my shanks! I have missed it. Which way went the
procession?” The man of bonds and pieces remained
gaping for the answer of the tapestry weaver, who stood,
cross-legged, leaning on his staff, with a face immovable as
granite. It was a day of triumph, a time of holiday, and
Michel had for once quitted his bags and desk to sun
himself in the glory of his fellow-townsmen. “Weaver, I
say, which way went the procession, and where shall I
find it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It went, after some turnings, into the churchyard.
Take up a handful of mould, and, in truth, you clutch a
part of what you seek.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, thou art drunk, merry, or mad! The churchyard
and mould! I ask you where went, where <i>is</i>, the
procession?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where I tell you. I saw it pass by me, and after some
windings and shiftings, I saw each brave puppet—that
strutted as though the angels were looking at it—I saw it
shrink, and bend, and totter, and the yellowness of age
crept over it, and its eye faded, and its hair whitened, and
it crawled into the earth as the fox slinks beneath his cover.
The trumpets lay dumb and cankering in the soil—the
rustling flags dropped tinder at the breeze—the rust-eaten
sword crumbled beneath the mattock of the digger, and
rank grass grows above the pomp of the last hour.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, Schatten, thou art dreaming. Blessed St Mary!
thou surely didst not see the sight, else thou hadst told me
a truer story of its progress.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not so: trust me, I saw the revel—but I beheld it from
the pinnacle of time; and I tell you again, all the men who
passed me I watched into the churchyard. Their haughty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>eyes—their trophies, flags, and clamorous pipes—I say to
you, they are dust! The shout of triumph hath died in the
distance, and <i>hic jacet</i> is now the only tongue.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So, so—a riddle,” crowed the scrivener; and he hobbled
on to seek a less perplexing respondent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such were, at times, the answers of old Schatten, who,
when he pleased, could be as grave and oracular as a father
confessor. Such were his reflections on pageants which, to
many thoughtless and happy minds, were the symbols of all
earthly greatness. It was his pastime to analyse appearance—to
unravel the glossy web of policy—to unfold the swathings
of vain pomp and ceremony, and point to the foul
mummy they encased. Yet would he vary this custom with
smiles and laughter, and witty sayings, which gave a savour
to the wine they honoured. He would, with his thin voice
troll a song in praise of beauty, and, with quick conceits,
prick on lusty youth to deeds of jollity and wild adventure;
nay, he would often mingle in the revelry. Many a time
have the townsfolk of Beauvais laughed at the gambols of
old Schatten, who, pranked in his best, would trip it with
some blue-eyed fair one, who, seemingly unconscious of
the deformity of her partner, would glide through the dance
all smiles and sweetness, as though mortal youth were
wedded to immortality, and wrinkles and grey hairs were
not the inheritance of the children of earth. Alas! but a
few months, or weeks, and the poor maiden—she who
seemed the embodied principle of beauty and motion—was
as the “clods of the valley,” a mass of blank insensibility.</p>

<p class='c010'>Various were the ways by which old Schatten had
insinuated himself into the good graces of the people of
Beauvais. To please them he would, when in the humour,
act twenty different parts—now he would be a learned
doctor, and now a mountebank; at times he would utter
the wisdom of sages—at times play a hundred antic tricks,
making his audience shout with merriment. For one long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>winter did Schatten profoundly lecture upon laurels, crowns,
swords, and money-bags; and, like a skilful chemist, would
he analyse their component parts.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This,” cried Schatten, producing a semblance of the
wreath, “this is the laurel crown of one of the Cæsars.
How fresh and green the leaves remain! Ha! there is no
such preservative as innocent blood—it embalms the names
of mighty potentates, who else had never been heard of:
steeped in it, deformity becomes loveliness—fame colours
her most lasting pictures with its paint! The fields that
grew this branch were richly manured: tens of thousands
of hearts lay rotting there; the light of thousands of eyes
was quenched; palaces and hovels, in undistinguished
heaps, were strewn about the soil; there lay the hoary
and the unborn; the murdered wife and the outraged
virgin—and showers of tears falling on this garden of agony
and horror, it was miraculously fertile—for lo! it gave
forth this one branch, to deck the forehead of one man! In
the veins that seam its leaves are the heart strings of
murdered nations; it is the plant of fire and blood, reaped
by the sword!—Such is the conqueror’s laurel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And here is the despot’s diadem!—Many a time, like
glowing iron, hath it seared the brows it circled. Of what
is it composed? What wonderful ingredients meet in this
quintessence of worldly wealth? See, the passions and the
feelings that helped to make it still haunt their handiwork.
Their shadows live in its glittering metal and its flashing
gems. Full-blooded power, with a demon’s eye, glares
from this ruby—leprous fear trembles in these pearls—in
every diamond, care or compunction weeps a tear! Throughout
the gold I see a thousand forms, dawning and fading
like hues in heated steel:—there, fancy detects the assassin
with his knife;—there, the bondsman snaps his chain;—there,
is the headsman;—there, the civil war! These are
the shades that haunt the despot’s crown; that wear him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>waking, and screech to him in his sleep. A nation’s groan
is pent up in its round. It is a living thing that eats into
the brain of the possessor, making him mad and drunk for
blood and power!</p>

<p class='c010'>“The miser’s money-bag!—Another monster—all throat.
Could its owner have put the sun itself within this bag, the
world for him had been in darkness—perpetual night had
cast a pall upon creation—the fruits of earth had withered
in the bud, and want and misery been universal; whilst he,
the thrifty villain! smugly lived in bloom, and in his very
baseness found felicity! And yet, what was the worth of
all this bag contained? Though it was stuffed with wealth,
it was hung about with fears. As its owner slid his palm
into the heap, he would start as though he felt the hand of
death were hidden there to grasp him. He was almost
blind within a world of beauty. His eye saw no images
save those painted by gold; his ears heard not, save when
the metal tinkled; his tongue was dumb, if it spoke not of
wealth; the glittering pieces were to him the children of his
heart and soul—dull offspring of the foulest appetites; yet
he hugged them to his bosom—he hugged them, and in his
dying hour they turned to snakes, and stung him in the
embrace! This is the miser’s money-bag—the abode of
reptiles, the sepulchre of the soul!</p>

<p class='c010'>“The sword!—Ceremony sanctifies it. Some kingly
words are spoken—a trumpet is blown; straightway the
sword is <i>ennobled</i>!</p>

<p class='c010'>“The lawyer’s gown!—the masquerading dress of common-sense.
There is a living instinct in its web: let golden
villainy come under it, and with a thought it flows and
spreads, and gives an ample shelter to the thing it covers;
let poor knavery seek it, and it shrinks and curtains up,
and leaves the trembling victim naked to the court!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus, in his graver moments, would old Schatten preach
to his hearers; then, with a thought, he would break from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>the solemn discourse, and make merriment with the self-same
objects. Thus, like a skilful juggler, he would hold
the conqueror’s laurel, that hardy plant, to his lips, and
with a puff blow it into dust; he would change the tiara
into a huge snake, monstrous and ugly, and make the
beholders start at its contortions. The long purse he
would ravel into a shroud; he would melt the sword into
drops of blood, and turn the lawyer’s gown into a net of
steel. Whilst these tricks made him a favourite with the
young and gay, his learning, and the thousand stories he
had of men of all ages and of all ranks, rendered him an
oracle of wisdom to the studious. It was observed that
Schatten, whilst narrating any history, always spoke as
though he had been an eye-witness of the circumstance
he detailed; nay, as though he had known their most
secret thoughts.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c010'>And who is Schatten, whose history is yet unfinished?
Who is this mysterious Weaver, whose deeds, if chronicled,
would fill thousands of folios? He is everywhere about us:
in the solitude of our chamber, in the press and throng of
the street, in the wilderness and in the city.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>THE WINE CELLAR<br /><i>A “MORALITY”</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Stephen Curlew</span> was a thrifty goldsmith in the reign of
the Second Charles. His shop was a mine of metal: he
worked for the Court, although, we fear, his name is not to
be found in any record in the State-Paper Office. Stephen
was a bachelor, and, what is strange, he never felt—that is,
he never complained of—his loneliness. His chased ewers,
his embossed goblets, his gold in bars, were to him wife and
children. Midas was his only kinsman. He would creep
among his treasures, like an old grey rat, and rub his hands,
and smile, as if communing with the wealth about him.
He had so long hugged gold to his heart that it beat for
nothing else. Stephen was a practical philosopher; for he
would meekly take the order—nay, consult the caprice—of
the veriest popinjay with the humility of a pauper, when, at
a word, he might have out-blazoned lords and earls. If this
be not real philosophy, thought Stephen, as he walked
slipshod at the heels of his customers, what is?</p>
<p class='c010'>Stephen was a man of temperance; he was content to see
venison carved on his hunting-cups; he cared not to have
it in his larder. His eyes would melt at clustering grapes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>chased on banquet goblets, but no drop of the living juice
passed the goldsmith’s lips. Stephen only gave audience to
Bacchus when introduced by Plutus. Such was the frugality
of Stephen to his sixty-fifth year; and then, or his name
had not been eternised in this our page, temptation fell
upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was eight o’clock on a raw spring evening, and Stephen
sat alone in his back-room. There was no more fire upon
the hearth than might have lain in a tinder-box, but Stephen
held his parchment hands above it, and would not be cold.
A small silver lamp, with a short wick—for the keen
observation of Stephen had taught him the scientific truth,
that the less the wick, the less the waste of oil—glowed, a
yellow speck in the darkness. On the table lay a book,
a treatise on precious stones; and on Stephen’s knee,
<i>Hermes, the True Philosopher</i>. Stephen was startled from
a waking dream by a loud and hasty knocking at the door.
Mike, the boy, was out; but it could not be he. Stephen
took up the lamp, and was creeping to the door, when his
eye caught the silver, and he again placed it upon the table,
and felt his way through the shop. Unbolting the five
bolts of the door, but keeping fast the chain, Stephen
demanded “who was there?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I bear a commission from Sir William Brouncker, and
I’m in haste.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stay you a minute—but a minute,” and Stephen hurried
back for the lamp, then hastily returned, opened the door,
and the visitor passed the threshold.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tis not Charles!” cried Stephen, alarmed at his
mistake, for he believed he had heard the voice of Sir
William’s man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No matter for that, Stephen; you work for men, and
not for Christian names. Come, I have a job for you”; and
the visitor, with the easy, assured air of a gallant, lounged
into the back-parlour, followed by the tremulous Stephen.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Sir William——” began the goldsmith.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He bade me use his name; the work I’d have you do
is for myself. Fear not: here’s money in advance,” and
the stranger plucked from his pocket a purse, which in its
ample length lay like a bloated snake upon the table.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stephen smiled, and said, “Your business, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“See here,” and the stranger moved the lamp immediately
between them, when, for the first time, Stephen clearly saw
the countenance of his customer. His face was red as
brick, and his eyes looked deep as the sea, and glowed
with good humour. His mouth was large and frank, and
his voice came as from the well of truth. His hair fell in
curls behind his ears, and his moustache, black as coal,
made a perfect crescent on his lip, the points upwards.
Other men may be merely good fellows, the stranger
seemed the best. “See here,” he repeated, and produced
a drawing on a small piece of paper, “can you cut me this
in a seal ring?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Humph!” and Stephen put on his spectacles; “the
subject is——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bacchus squeezing grape-juice into the cup of Death,”
said the stranger.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An odd conceit,” cried the goldsmith.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We all have our whims, or woe to the sellers,” said the
customer. “Well, can it be done?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Surely, sir, surely. On what shall it be cut?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“An emerald, nothing less. It is the drinker’s stone.
In a week, Master Curlew?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This day week, sir, if I live in health.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The day came. Stephen was a tradesman of his word,
and the stranger sat in the back-parlour, looking curiously
into the ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Per Bacco!</i> Rarely done. Why, Master Curlew, thou
hast caught the very chops of glorious Liber, his swimming
eyes, and blessed mouth. Ha! ha! thou hast put thy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>heart into the work, Master Curlew; and how cunningly
hast thou all but hid the dart of death behind the thyrsus
of the god! How his life-giving hand clutches the pulpy
cluster, and with what a gush comes down the purple rain,
plashing into rubies in the cup of Mors!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was my wish to satisfy, most noble sir,” said
Stephen, meekly, somewhat confounded by the loud praises
of the speaker.</p>

<p class='c010'>“May you never be choked with a grape-stone, Master
Curlew, for this goodly work. Ha!” and the speaker
looked archly at the withered goldsmith; “it hath cost thee
many a headache ere thou couldst do this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I may say it, I have laboured hard at the craft—have
been a thrifty, sober man,” said Stephen.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sober! Ha! ha! ha!” shouted the speaker, and
his face glowed redder, and his eyes melted; “sober!
why, thou wast begot in a wine cask, and suckled by a
bottle, or thou hadst never done this. By the thigh of
Jupiter! he who touched this,” and the stranger held
up the ring to his eye, and laughed again, “he who touched
this hath never known water. Tut! man, were I to pink
thee with a sword thou’dst bleed wine!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I,” cried Stephen, “I bleed,” and he glanced fearfully
towards the door, and then at the stranger, who continued
to look at the ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The skin of the sorriest goat shall sometimes hold the
choicest liquor,” said the stranger, looking into the dry
face of the goldsmith. “Come, confess, art thou not a
sly roysterer? Or art thou a hermit over thy drops, and
dost count flasks alone? Ay! ay! well, to thy cellar,
man; and—yes—thine arms are long enough—bring up
ten bottles of thy choicest Malaga.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I!—my cellar!—Malaga!” stammered Stephen.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Surely thou hast a cellar?” and the stranger put his
hat upon the table with the air of a man set in for a carouse.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“For forty years, but it hath never known wine,” cried
the goldsmith. “I—I have never known wine.” The
stranger said nothing; but, turning full upon Stephen, and,
placing his hands upon his knees, he blew out his flushing
cheeks like a bagpipe, and sat with his eyes blazing upon
the heretic. “No, never!” gasped Stephen, terrified, for
a sense of his wickedness began to possess him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And thou dost repent?” asked the stranger, with a
touch of mercy towards the sinner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I—humph! I’m a poor man,” cried Curlew; “yes,
though I’m a goldsmith, and seem rich, I—I’m poor!
poor!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, ’tis lucky I come provided,” and the stranger
placed upon the table a couple of flasks. Whether he took
them from under his cloak, or evoked them through the
floor, Stephen knew not; but he started at them as they stood
rebukingly upon his table, as if they had been two sheeted
ghosts. “Come, glasses,” cried the giver of the wine.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Glasses!” echoed Stephen, “in my house!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Right, glasses! No—cups, and let them be gold
ones!” and the bacchanal, for it was plain he was such, waved
his arm with an authority which Stephen attempted not to
dispute, but rose and hobbled into the shop, and returned
with two cups just as the first cork was drawn. “Come,
there’s sunlight in that, eh?” cried the stranger, as he
poured the wine into the vessels. “So, thou hast never
drunk wine? Well, here’s to the baptism of thy heart!”
And the stranger emptied the cup, and his lips smacked
like a whip.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Stephen Curlew tasted the wine, and looked around,
below, above; and the oaken wainscot did not split in
twain, nor did the floor yawn, nor the ceiling gape.
Stephen tasted a second time; thrice did he drink, and he
licked his mouth as a cat licks the cream from her whiskers,
and, putting his left hand upon his belly, softly sighed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“Ha! ha! another cup! I know thou wilt,” and
Stephen took another, and another; and the two flasks
were in brief time emptied. They were, however, speedily
followed by two more, placed by the stranger on the table,
Stephen opening his eyes and mouth at their mysterious
appearance. The contents of these were duly swallowed,
and lo! another two stood before the goldsmith, or, as he
then thought, four.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There never was such a Bacchus!” cried Stephen’s
customer, eyeing the ring. “Why, a man may see his
stomach fairly heave, and his cheek ripen with wine: yet,
till this night, thou hadst never tasted the juice! What—what
could have taught thee to carve the god so capitally?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Instinct—instinct,” called out the goldsmith, his lips
turned to clay by too much wine.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And yet,” said the stranger, “I care not so much
for—— How old art thou, Stephen?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sixty-five,” and Stephen hiccupped.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I care not so much for thy Death, Stephen; instinct
should have made thee a better hand at Death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tis a good Death,” cried the goldsmith, with unusual
boldness, “a most sweet Death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tis too broad—the skeleton of an alderman with the
flesh dried upon him. He hath not the true desolation,
the ghastly nothingness, of the big bugbear. No matter;
I’m content; but this I’ll say, though thou hast shown
thyself a professor at Bacchus, thou art yet but a poor
apprentice at Death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Stephen Curlew answered not with words, but he snored
very audibly. How long he slept he could not well discover,
but when he awoke he found himself alone; no, not alone,
there stood upon the table an unopened flask of wine. In
a moment the mystery broke upon him—and he sprang to
his feet with a shriek, and rushed into the shop. No—he
had not been drugged by thieves—all was as it should be.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>The stranger, like an honest and courteous man, had taken
but his own; and, without disturbing the sleeper, had
quitted the house. And Stephen Curlew, the wine glowing
in his heart—yea, down to his very nails, stood and smiled
at the unopened flask before him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stephen continued to eye the flask; and though its donor
had shared with him he knew not how many bottles,
Stephen was resolved that not one drop of the luscious
juice before him should wet an alien throat. But how—where
to secure it? For, in the new passion which seized
upon the goldsmith, the one flask seemed to him more
precious than the costly treasure in his shop—a thing to be
guarded with more scrupulous affection—more jealous love.
In what nook of his house to hide the glorious wealth—what
corner, where it might escape the profane glances and
itching fingers of his workmen? The thought fell in a
golden flash upon him—the cellar—ay, the cellar! Who
of his household ever thought of approaching the cellar?
Stephen seized the flask and lamp, and paused. The
cellar had no lock! No matter; he had a bag of three-inch
nails and a stout hammer.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c010'>The next morning neighbours met at the closed door and
windows of the goldsmith, and knocked and shouted,
shouted and knocked. They were, however, reduced to a
crowbar, and, at length, burst into the house. Every place
was searched, but there was nowhere visible old Stephen
Curlew. Days passed on, and strange stories filled the ears
of men. One neighbour vowed that he had had a dream
or a vision, he knew not which, wherein he saw the goldsmith
whirled down the Strand in a chariot drawn by a lion
and a tiger, and driven by a half-naked young man, wearing
a panther skin, and on his head vine-leaves and ivy. An
old woman swore that she had seen Stephen carried away
by a dozen devils (very much in liquor), with red faces and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>goat legs. However, in less than a month, the goldsmith’s
nephew, a scrivener’s clerk, took possession of Curlew’s
wealth, and became a new-made butterfly with golden
wings. As for Stephen, after various speculations, it was
concluded, to the satisfaction of all parties, that he must
have been carried away by Satan himself, and the nephew
cared not to combat popular opinions. But such, in truth,
was not the end of the goldsmith. Hear it.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c010'>Stephen, possessed by the thought of the cellar, with the
one flask, a lamp, nails, and hammer, proceeded to the
sacred crypt. He arrived in the vault, and having kissed
the flask, reverently put it down, and straightway addressed
himself to the work. Closing the door, he drove the first
nail, the second, third; and borrowing new strength from
the greatness of his purpose, he struck each nail upon the
head with the force and precision of a Cyclops, burying it
deep in the oak. With this new-found might he drove
eleven nails; the twelfth was between his thumb and
finger, when looking round—oh! sad mishap, heavy mischance!
awful error!—he had driven the nails from the
wrong side! In a word—and we tremble while we write
it—he had nailed himself in! There he stood, and there
stood the flask. He gasped with horror; his foot stumbled,
struck the lamp, it fell over, and the light went out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Shall we write further on the agony of Stephen Curlew?
Shall we describe how he clawed and struck at the door,
now in the hope to wrench a nail, and now to alarm the
breathing men above? No; we will not dwell upon the
horror; it is enough that the fate of the goldsmith was
dimly shadowed forth in the following paragraph of last
Saturday:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some labourers, digging a foundation near”—no, we
will not name the place, for the family of the Curlews is not
yet extinct, and there may be descendants in the neighbourhood—“near——,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>found a skeleton. A hammer was beside
it, with several long nails: a small wine flask was also found
near the remains, which, it is considered, could not have
been in the vault in which they were discovered less than a
century and three-quarters!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Oh, ye heads of families! and oh, ye thrifty, middle-aged
bachelors, boarding with families, or growing mouldy by
yourselves, never, while ye live, forget the terrible end of
Stephen Curlew. And oh, ye heads of families—and oh,
ye aforesaid bachelors, albeit ye have only one bottle left,
never, <span class='fss'>NEVER NAIL UP THE WINE CELLAR</span>!</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>RECOLLECTIONS OF GUY FAWKES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c023'>“When a man has once been very famous for jests and merry
adventures, he is made to adopt all the jests that want a father,
and many times such as are unworthy of him.”—Motteux’s <i>Life
of Rabelais</i>.</p>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>At</span> midnight, on the fifth of November, in the year of grace
one thousand six hundred and five, Guido Fawkes, “gentleman,”
was discovered, “booted and spurred,” in the vicinity
of St Stephen’s Chapel, having on his person “three matches,
a tinder-box, and a dark lantern”; and purposing by means
of gunpowder to blow up, says King James, “the whole
nobility, the most part of the knights and gentry, besides the
whole judges of the land, with <i>most of the lawyers</i> and the
whole clerks!” For the one indiscretion Guido Fawkes
forfeited his gentility, and became a proverb of wickedness.
In boyhood we looked upon Guido Fawkes, gentleman, as
one little lower than the devil; he had four horns, and a
dozen tails. “Years that bring the philosophic mind” have
divested him of these excrescences and appendages, and
Guido Fawkes now appears to matured charities merely a
person of a singularly eccentric disposition.</p>
<p class='c010'>Some five and twenty years ago it was the patriotic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>custom of the authorities of an Isle of Sheppy dockyard
to bestow upon their apprentices a few waggon-loads of
resinous timber, that a bonfire worthy of the cause it
celebrated might be kindled from the public purse—that
the effigy of the arch-fiend Guy might be consumed
in a fire three times hotter than the fire of a furnace. Such
fierce liberality was not lost upon the townspeople; their
ardour in the burning business smouldered not; every man
subscribed his plank or log; and, from the commissioner
in his uniform, to Bobby in his pinafore, the fifth of
November glowed, in the calendar of their minds, a pillar
of fire. For a month before that day, the coming anniversary
busied the thoughts of boyish executioners, resolved
to show their patriotism in the appointments of the Guy—in
the grotesque iniquity of his face—in the cumbrous state
of his huge arm-chair. To beg clothes from door to door
was the business of every lover of Church and State. To
ask for a coat—a pair of breeches—a shirt (the frill could
be made of paper)—hose and hat, was not mendicity, but
the fulfilment of a high social duty.</p>

<p class='c010'>Guy Fawkes would at length be dressed. A philosopher
might have found good matter in his eleemosynary suit. In
the coat of the bloodthirsty wretch he might have recognised
the habit of Scum, the slop-seller, a quiet trader afloat
of twenty thousand pounds—in the vest of the villainous
ruffian the discarded waistcoat of Smallgrog, the honest
landlord of a little house for sailors—in the stockings of
the atrocious miscreant the hose of the equitable Weevil,
biscuit-contractor to his Majesty’s fleet—whilst for the
leather of the fiend-like effigy, Guy Fawkes was to be
exhibited, and afterwards burnt in, the broad-toed shoes of
that best of men, Trap, the town attorney.</p>

<p class='c010'>The chair, too, in which Guy Fawkes sat, might it not
have some day enshrined a justice of the peace? and the
lantern fixed in the hand of the diabolical, lynx-eyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>monster, might it not have been the property of the most
amiable and most somnolent of all the Blue Town watchmen?
A mask was fixed upon the effigy, or the lump of
clay kneaded into human features, and horribly or delicately
expressed, according to the benevolent art of the makers!—might
not the same visor have been worn by a perfect
gentleman, with considerable advantage, at a masquerade?—might
not the clay nose and mouth of the loathsome
traitor have borne an accidental likeness to the very pink
of patriots? Let philosophy ponder well on Guy Fawkes.</p>

<p class='c010'>We will now attempt our childish recollections of the
great Guy. We have waked at midnight, perhaps dreaming
of the bonfire about to blaze, and thinking we heard the
distant chorus sounding to the advent of the Mighty Terror.
No, it was the sea booming across the marsh, the wind
rising or falling. There was nothing for it but to go to
sleep and dream of unextinguishable squibs and crackers.
At length four o’clock arrives; the cocks crow—the boys
can’t be long now. There—hark!—how the chant comes
up the street, like one voice—the voice of a solitary droning
witch! We lie breathless, and shape to ourselves Guy
Fawkes in the dark! Our hearts beat quicker and quicker
as the chant becomes louder; and we sit up in bed, as the
boys approach the door, and, oh! how we wish to be with
them! There—there they are in full chorus! Hark:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The fifth of November, as I can remember,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>We feel an unutterable pang, for loudest among the loud,
we hear the shrill voice of Jack Tarleton. “Ha!” we
sigh, “<i>his</i> mother lets <i>him</i> out.” The bitterness passes
away with the—</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>“Rejoicing in the captivity of a suit of clothes stuffed with hay”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c009'>And now the procession moves on, and the voices die in
the distance, and we feel we are left alone; and, in a few
minutes, we hear new revellers, rejoicing in the captivity of
a suit of clothes stuffed with hay, and called Guy Fawkes.
Guy Fawkes! Guy Fawkes! who—what <i>is</i> Guy Fawkes?
We had been told that he had been caught with a lantern,
tinder-box and matches, ready to blow up thousands of
barrels of gunpowder, and so to destroy the king, bishops,
and members of Parliament. It must be shocking—very
shocking; still, we could not perfectly envisage the atrocity—we
could not make out the full horror. We had the
undefined sense of the greatness of a king, though we
hardly dared to hope we should ever see one. We had
a less remote notion of the nature of a bishop, having been
helped somewhat in our speculations by the person of the
curate at the garrison church. “Curates may come to be
bishops, only bishops are very much greater; and curates
have nothing upon their heads, whereas certain bishops might
wear mitres.” On learning this we thought that bishops
were merely full-grown curates; in the same way that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>had seen Poland hens with their topknots of feathers only
the spring before bare-headed little chicks. It was thus,
in the irreverence of childhood, we disposed of the whole
bench of bishops. But now came we to the difficulty—what,
what could be a member of Parliament? Was it
a living thing? If so, had it a voice? Could it speak?
Could it sit? Could it say yes and no? Could it walk?
Could it turn? Or was it merely an image? Was it pulled
by wires, like sister Jenny’s doll? We had been told that
members of Parliament made laws. What <i>were</i> laws?
Were they the lions and unicorns on the king’s arms?
Were they a better sort of cake, too dear for everybody to buy?
Little boys ate parliament-cakes—were law-cakes for men?
If so, were they gilt or plain?—with comfits or without?</p>

<p class='c010'>It is no matter, we thought, being unable to satisfy ourselves:
it is no matter. Guy Fawkes—that shadowy,
terrible mystery—had once lived and tried to kill the
king, the full-grown curates, and those undivined riddles—members
of Parliament. We again went to our first
question. Who <i>was</i> Guy Fawkes? Did he have a
father and mother? Was Guy Fawkes ever a little boy?
and did he fly a kite and play at marbles? If so, how
could he have ever thought it worth his while to trouble
himself with other matters? There was something terrifying
in the idea of having played with Guy Fawkes. We
fancied him at taw—we saw him <i>knuckle down</i>. No—it
could not be; the imagination of the child could not dwell
upon such an impossibility. Guy Fawkes a boy!—a baby!
now shaking a rattle—now murmuring as he fed, his
mother smiling down upon him! No, no—it was impossible;
Guy Fawkes was never born—he was from the
first a man—he never could have been a baby. He seemed
to us a part of the things that had always been, and always
would be—a piece of grim eternity; a principle of everlasting
wickedness.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Is it in childhood alone—is it only in the dim imaginings
of infancy—in the wandering guesses of babyhood, that we
manifest this ignorance? When the full-grown thief is
hanged, do we not sometimes forget that he was the child
of misery and vice—born for the gallows—nursed for the
halter? Did we legislate a little more for the cradle, might
we not be spared some pains for the hulks?</p>

<p class='c010'>And then we had been told that Guy Fawkes came from
Spain. Where was Spain? Was it a million miles away,
and what distance was a million miles? Were there little
boys in Spain, or were they all like Guy Fawkes? How
strange, and yet how delightful to us did it seem to feel
that we were a part of the wonderful things about us! To
be at all upon this world—to be one at the great <i>show</i> of
men and women—to feel that when we grew bigger we
should know everything of kings, bishops, members of
Parliament, and Guy Fawkes! What a golden glory
hung about the undiscovered!</p>

<p class='c010'>And Guy Fawkes, we had heard, had his head cut off,
and his body cut into quarters! Could this be true?
Could men do to men what we had seen Fulk the butcher
do to sheep? How much, we thought, had little boys to
grow out of before they could agree to this! And then,
when done, what was the good of it—what <i>could</i> be the
good of it? Was Guy Fawkes eaten—if not, <i>why</i> cut
him up?</p>

<p class='c010'>Had Guy Fawkes a wife, and little boys and girls? Did
he love his children, and buy them toys and apples—or,
like Sawney Bean, did he devour them? Did Guy Fawkes
say his prayers?</p>

<p class='c010'>Had Guy Fawkes a friend? Did he ever laugh—did
he ever tell a droll story? Did Guy Fawkes ever sing
a song? Like Frampton, the Blue Town Barber, did
Guy Fawkes ever get drunk? At length we put to
ourselves the question of questions:—</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span><i>Was there ever such a man as Guy Fawkes? Did Guy
Fawkes ever live?</i></p>

<p class='c010'>This query annoyed us with the doubt that we had been
tricked into a hate, a fear, a loathing, a wonder—and a
mixture of these passions and emotions, for a fib. We
felt disappointed when we felt the reality of Guy Fawkes
to be doubtful. We had heard of griffins and unicorns,
of dragons that had eaten men like apples, and had then
been told that there never had been any such thing. If
we were not to believe in a dragon, why should we believe
in Guy Fawkes? After all, was the whole story but
make-game?</p>

<p class='c010'>The child passively accepts a story of the future, he can
bring his mind up to a thing promised, but wants faith in
the past. The cause is obvious; he recollects few things
gone, but is full of things to come. Hence Guy Fawkes
was with us the ogre of a nursery; we could have readily
believed, especially after the Story of Beauty and the Beast,
that he married Goody Two Shoes, and was the father of
Little Red Riding Hood.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Guy Fawkes grows with us from boyhood to youth.
He gets flesh and blood with every November; he is no
longer the stuffed plaything of a schoolboy or the grotesque
excuse for begging vagabonds, but the veritable Guy Fawkes,
“gentleman.” We see him, “Thomas Percy’s alleged
man,” at the door of the vault, “booted and spurred”; we
behold that “very tall and desperate fellow,” lurking in the
deep of night, with looks of deadly resolution, pounced upon
by that vigilant gentleman of the privy-chamber, Sir Thomas
Knevit! We go with Guido, “the new Mutius Scævola,
born in England,” before the council, where “he often
smiles in scornful manner, not only avowing the fact, but
repenting only, with the said Scævola, his failing in the
execution thereof.” We think of him “answering quickly
to every man’s objection, scoffing at any idle questions which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>were propounded to him, and jesting with such as he thought
had no authority to examine him.” And then we think
of the thanksgiving of the great James, who gave praise
that, had the intent of the wicked prevailed, he should not
have “died ingloriously in an ale-house, a stew, or such
vile place,” but with “the best and most honourable
company.”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c017'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Guy Fawkes is, in our baby thoughts, a mysterious vision,
one of the shadows of evil advancing on the path of childhood.
We grow older, and the substances of evil come
close upon us—we see their dark lantern, and snuff the
brimstone.</p>

</div>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Every</span> generation compared to the age it immediately
succeeds is but a further lapse from Paradise. Every
grandfather is of necessity a wiser, kinder, nobler being
that the grandson doomed to follow him—every grandmother
chaster, gentler, more self-denying, more devoted
to the beauty of goodness, than the giddy, vain, thoughtless
creature, who in her time is sentenced to be grandmother
to somebody, whose still increased defects will only serve
to bring out the little lustre of the gentlewoman who preceded
her. Man, undoubtedly, had at the first a fixed
amount of goodness bestowed upon him; but this goodness,
by being passed from generation to generation, has, like
a very handsome piece of coin, with arms and legend in
bold relief, become so worn by continual transit, that it
demands the greatest activity of faith to believe that which
is now current in the world, to be any portion of the
identical goodness with which the human race was originally
endowed. Hapless creatures are we! Moral paupers
of the nineteenth century, turning a shining cheek upon one
another, and by the potent force of swagger, passing off our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>thin, worn, illegible pieces of coin—how often, no thicker,
no weightier than a spangle on a player’s robe!—when our
glorious ancestors, in the grandeur of their goodness, could
ring down musical shekels! Nay, as we go back, we find
the coin of excellence so heavy, so abounding, that how any
man—Samson perhaps excepted—had strength enough to
carry his own virtues about him, puzzles the effeminacy of
present thought. Folks then were doubtless made grave,
majestic in their movements by the very weight of their
excellence. Whilst we, poor anatomies—skipjacks of the
nineteenth century—we carry all our ready virtue in either
corner of our waistcoat pocket, and from its very lightness,
are unhappily enabled to act all sorts of unhallowed capers—to
forget the true majesty of man in the antics of the
mountebank. Forlorn degradation of the human race!</p>
<p class='c010'>But the tears of the reader—for if he have a heart of
flesh, it is by this time melting in his eyes—are not confidently
demanded for only the one generation whereof
(seeing he is our reader) he is certainly not the worst
unit: but we here require of him to weep for posterity;
yes, to subscribe a rivulet of tears for the generations to
come. The coinage of the virtues at present in circulation
among us is so thin, so defaced, so battered, so clipt, that
it appears to us wholly impossible that any portion of the
currency can descend a couple of generations lower. What,
then, is to become of our grandchildren? Without one
particle of golden truth and goodness left to them, for we
cannot take into account the two or three pieces hoarded—as
old ladies have hoarded silver pennies—what remains,
what alternative for our descendants but to become a
generation of coiners? Can any man withstand the terror
of this picture, wherein all the world are shown as so many
passers of pocket-pieces, lacquered over with something that
seems like gold and silver, but which, indeed, is only seeming?
A picture wherein he who is the ablest hypocrite—passing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>off the greatest amount of false coin upon his neighbor—shall
appear the most virtuous person! Is not this
an appalling scene to contemplate? Yet, if there be
any truth in a common theory, if there be any veracity in
the words written in a thousand pages, uttered at every
fireside, dropt in the casual meeting of man and man at
door-steps, in by-lanes, highways, and market-places—the
picture we have shadowed forth must become an iron
present.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We shall never see such times again!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The world isn’t what it used to be.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I was a boy, things hadn’t come to this pass.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The world gets wickeder and wickeder.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Since the builders of Babel were scattered, these thoughts
have been voiced in every tongue. From the very discontent
and fantasticalness of his nature, man looks backward
at the lost Paradise of another age. He affects to
snuff the odour of its fruits and flowers, and with a
melancholy shaking of the head, sees, or thinks he sees,
the flashing of the fiery swords that guard them. And
then, in the restlessness of his heart, in the peevishness
and discontent of his soul, he says all sorts of bitter things
of the generations he has fallen among; and, from the
vanished glory of the past, predicts increasing darkness for
the future. Happily, the prophesying cannot be true; and
happily, too, for the condition of the prophet, he knows it
will not. But then there is a sort of comfort in the waywardness
of discontent; at times, a soothing music to the
restlessness of the soul in the deep bass of hearty
grumbling.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ingratitude of the act is entirely forgotten in the
pleasure. “Ha! those were the merry days—the golden
times of England they were!” May not this be heard
from the tradesman, the mechanic, as he is borne past
Tilbury Fort, and the thoughts of Queen Elizabeth, of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“golden days,” ring in his brain; and living only in the
nineteenth century, he has some vague, perplexing notion
that he has missed an Eden, only by a hundred years or two?
He thinks not—why should he?—of the luxury he now
purchases for a shilling; a luxury, not compassable in those
golden days by all the power and wealth of all the combining
sovereigns of the earth, for he is a passenger of a
Gravesend steamboat, the fare twelvepence.</p>

<p class='c010'>We would not forget that wonder of Elizabeth’s navy,
the <i>Great Harry</i>. No; we would especially remember it,
to compare the marvel, with all its terrors, to the agent of
our day, which, wrought and directed from a few gallons of
water, makes the winged ship but as a log—a dead leviathan
upon the deep; which, in the certainty and intensity of its
power of destruction must, in the fulness of time, make
blood-spilling war bankrupt, preaching peace with all men,
even from “the cannon’s mouth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We are, however, a degenerate race. In our maudlin
sensibility, we have taken under our protection the very
brutes of the earth—the fowls of the air—the fish of the
sea. We have cast the majesty of the law around the
asses of the reign of Victoria—have assured to live geese a
property in their own feathers—have, with a touch of tenderness,
denounced the wood-plugged claws of the lobsters of
Billingsgate. We have a society, whose motto, spiritually,
is—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Never to link our pleasure or our pride</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With suffering of the meanest thing that lives.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Very different, indeed, was the spirit of the English
people, when their good and gracious Queen Elizabeth
smiled sweetly upon bull dogs, and found national music
in the growl, the roar, and the yell of a bear-garden;
whereto, in all the courtesy of a nobler and more virtuous
age, the sovereign led the French ambassador; that, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>chroniclers tell us, Monsieur might arrive at a sort of
comparative knowledge of English bravery, judging the
courage of the people by the stubborn daring of their
dogs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then we had no Epsom, with its high moralities—no
Ascot, with its splendour and wealth. Great, indeed, was
the distance—deep the abyss—between the sovereign and
the sovereign people.</p>

<p class='c010'>And in those merry, golden days of good Queen Bess, rank
was something; it had its brave outside, and preached its
high prerogative from externals. The nobleman declared
his nobility by his cloak, doublet and jerkin; by the plumes
in his hat; by the jewels flashing in his shoes. Society, in
all its gradations, was inexorably marked by the tailor and
goldsmith.</p>

<p class='c010'>But what is the tailor of the nineteenth century? What
doth he for nobility? Alas! next to nothing. The gentleman
is no longer the creature of the tailor’s hands—the
being of his shop-board. The gentleman must dress himself
in ease, in affability, in the gentler and calmer courtesies of
life, to make distinguishable the nobility of his nature from
the homeliness, the vulgarity of the very man who, it may
be, finds nobility in shoe-leather. Thus, gentility of blood,
deprived by innovation of its external livery—denied the
outward marks of supremacy—is thrown upon its bare self
to make good its prerogative. Manner must now do the
former duty of fine clothes.</p>

<p class='c010'>State, too, was in the blessed times of Elizabeth a most
majestic matter. The queen’s carriage, unlike Victoria’s,
was a vehicle wondrous in the eyes of men as the chariot
of King Pharaoh. Now, does every poor man keep his
coach—price sixpence! How does the economy of luxury
vulgarise the indulgence?</p>
<div id='i080'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i080.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“Rank preached its high prerogative from externals”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c009'>Travelling was then a grave and serious adventure. The
horse-litter was certainly a more dignified means of transit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>than the fuming, boiling, roaring steam-engine, that rushes
forward with a man as though the human anatomy was no
more than a woolpack. In the good old times of Queen
Bess, a man might take his five long days and more for a
hundred miles, putting up, after a week’s jolting, at his
hostelry, the Queen’s Head of Islington, for one good
night’s rest, ere he should gird up his loins to enter
London. Now is man taught to lose all respect for the
hoariness of time by the quickness of motion. Now may
he pass over two hundred miles in some seven or eight hours
if he will, taking his first meal in the heart of Lancashire,
and his good-night glass at a Geneva palace in London.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Is it wonderful that our present days should abound more
in sinful levity than the days of the good Queen Elizabeth,
seeing that we may, in the same space of time, crowd so
much more iniquity? The truth is, science has thrown so
many hours upon our hands, that we are compelled to kill
them with all sorts of arrows—which, as moralists declare,
have mortal poison at the barb, however gay and brilliant
may be the feathers that carry it home. Dreadful will be
the time when that subtle fiend, science, shall perform
nearly all human drudgery; for then men in their very
idleness will have nought else to destroy save their own souls;
and the destruction will, of course, be quicker, and, to the
father of all mischief, much more satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again, in the good times of Elizabeth, humanity was
blessed with a modesty, a deference—in these days of
bronze, to be vainly sought for—towards the awfulness of
power, the grim majesty of authority. And if, indeed, it
happened that some outrageous wretch, forgetful of the
purpose of nature in creating him the Queen’s liegeman,
and therefore her property—if, for a moment, he should
cease to remember the fealty which, by the principle of the
divine right of kings, should be vital to him as the blood
in his veins—why, was there not provided for him, by the
benignity of custom and the law, a salutary remedy? If he
advanced a new opinion, had he not ears wherewith, by
hangman’s surgery, he might be cured of such disease?
If he took a mistaken view of the rights of his fellow-subjects,
might he not be taught to consider them from a
higher point of elevation, and so be instructed?</p>

<p class='c010'>Booksellers, in the merry time of Elizabeth, were enabled
to vindicate a higher claim to moral and physical daring than
is permitted to them in these dull and drivelling days. He
who published a book, questioning—though never so gently—the
prerogative of her Majesty to do just as the spirit
should move her, might have his right hand chopped off,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>and afterwards—there have been examples of such devotion—wave
his bloody stump, with a loyal shout of “God save
the Queen!” But these were merry days—golden days—in
which the royal prerogative was more majestic, more
awful than in the nineteenth century. And wherefore?
The reason is plain as the Queen’s arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>The king of beasts lives on flesh. His carnivorousness
is one of the great elements of his Majesty. So was it in
the times of Elizabeth, with the Queen’s prerogative. It
was for the most part fed upon flesh. It would be a curious
and instructive calculation could we arrive at the precise
number of noses, and arms, and hands, and human heads,
and quarters of human carcases, which—during the merry,
golden reign of Elizabeth, of those days we shall never see
again—were required by law to keep strong and lusty the
prerogative of the Virgin Queen! How, as the human
head festered and rotted above the city gates, was the prerogative
sweetened by the putrefaction! And then the
daily lessons preached by the mute horror of the dead man’s
mouth, to the human life daily passing beneath it! What
precepts of love and gentleness towards all men fell from
the shrivelled lips—what Christianity gleamed from the
withered eye-balls! How admirably were the every-day
thoughts of men associated with prerogative, its majesty for
ever preached by dead men’s tongues—its beauty visible in
dead men’s flesh. Those were the golden days—the merry
days—we shall never see such times again. Now, a poor
and frivolous race, we pass beneath Temple Bar, untaught
by the grim moralities that from its height were wont to
instruct our forefathers. In the days of Elizabeth we
might have lounged at the door of the city shopkeeper, and
whilst chaffering for a commodity of this world, have had
our thoughts elevated by a consideration of the ghastly
skull—grinning a comment upon all earthly vanities—above
us. Those days are gone—passed for ever. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>have now plate-glass and dainty painting, and precious
woods, in the shops of our tradesmen, but nought to take
us from the vanity of life—no prerogative of a Virgin
Queen, in the useful semblance of a <i>memento mori</i>.</p>
<div id='i083'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i083.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“Hangman’s surgery”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c009'>It is to the want of such stern yet wholesome monitors
we are doubtless to attribute the decay of the national
character. We are sunk in effeminacy, withered by the
fond ministerings of science. The road of life—which,
by its ruggedness, was wont to try the sinews of our
Elizabethan ancestors—we, their degenerate children, have
spread as with a carpet, and hung the walls around us with
radiant tapestry. The veriest household drudge of our
time is a Sardanapalus compared to the lackey of the
Virgin Queen. The tatterdemalion, who lives on highway
alms, may look down upon the beggar of Elizabeth; for
the mendicant of Victoria may, with his prayed-for pence,
purchase luxuries unknown to the Dives of former days.</p>

<p class='c010'>And what—if we listen to complaining patriotism—what
is the evil born of this? A loss of moral energy; a wasting
away of national fibre. Believe this melancholy philosophy,
and national weakness came in (a moral moth in the commodity)
with silk stockings. Ere then was the bearing of
man more majestic in the eyes of angels! For then was
the sword the type of station, a gentleman no more
appearing abroad without his rapier than a wasp without
its sting. Human life could not but lose part of its dignity
with its cold steel. What a fine comment on the charity,
the gentleness, the humanity of his fellow-men, did every
gentleman wear at his side! He was, in a manner, his own
law-maker, his own executioner. In the judgment of later
philosophy, we are prone to believe that the said gentlemen
may appear, at the best, ferocious simpletons—creatures
swaggering “between heaven and earth,” with their hands
upon their hilts, ready and yearning for a thrust at those
who took the wall of their gentility. Ha! those, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>were the good old days! And then came a whining, curd-complexioned
benevolence, and in progress of time, its thin,
white, womanly fingers unbuckled the sword-belt of the
bully, and organised police. Sword-makers were bankrupt,
and human nature lost a grace!</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus, it appears, the world has been from age to age
declining in virtue, and can only escape the very profound
of iniquity by a speedy dissolution. Every half dozen
years or so, a prophet growls from a cellar, or cries from
the altitude of a garret, the advent of the last day. An
earthquake, or some other convulsion (the particulars of
which are only vouchsafed to the prophet) is to destroy
the earth or London at least; whereupon old gentlemen
remove to Gravesend, and careful housewives take stock
of their plate. Now, every such prophecy, instead of
bewildering honest people with all sorts of fears, and all
sorts of anxieties for their personal property, ought to
make them sing thanksgiving songs for the promised
blessing. It being the creed of these people that the world
gets worse and worse, they would at least have the comfort
to know that they had seen the last of its wickedness.
For a moment, reader, we will suppose you one of these.
Consider, upon your own faith, what a terrible wretch will
necessarily be your great-great-great-great-great-grandson!
Well, would it not be satisfaction to you that this dragon
(we believe dragons are oviparous) should be crushed in
the egg of the future? How would you like your own
flesh and blood inevitably changed by the course of time
into the anatomy of something very like a demon? You
are bad enough as you are; that dismal truth your own
humility preaches to you; to say nothing of the plain
speaking of your neighbours. No; out of pure love and
pity for humanity, you ought to wish all the world to stop
with your own pulse. It is hard enough now, even for
the best of us, to keep on the respectable side of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>statutes; but, with the growing wickedness of the world,
we should like to know what sort of metal will the laws
be made of. The great social link must inevitably be a
fetter.</p>

<p class='c010'>How often have we stood, with the unseen tears in our
eyes, watching the nobility of the land, in nobility’s best
bib and tucker, winding in golden line to the drawing-room
of Queen Victoria! Alas! degenerate dukes—faded
duchesses. Marquises fallen upon evil times—marchionesses
very dim indeed! What are you to the
nobility of Elizabeth? What to the grandees of those
merry days, the golden shadow of which is brightness
itself to the cold, grey glimmering of the present? We
have yet one thought to comfort us; and that is, a half
belief that the court of Elizabeth was held as nothing to
all courts preceding; and so back, until Englishmen
mourned over the abomination of cloaks and vests,
sorrowing for those golden days, those good old times
of the painted Britons! Great was the virtue abounding
in <i>woad</i>; grievous the wilful iniquity woven in broad-cloth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Queen Elizabeth died—fair, regal bud!—in the sweetness
of virginity; and though the sun (by some despairing
effort) managed to rise the next morning, it has never
been wholly itself since. She died, and was brought to
Whitehall, to the great calamity of the fish then swimming
in the river; for a poet of the day, quoted by Camden,
has eternised the evil that in the hour fell upon Thames
flounders:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Queene was brought by water to Whitehall;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>At every stroke the oares teares let fall;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>More clung about the barge; fish under water</div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Wept out their eyes of pearle, and swame blinde after</i>,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I think the bargemen might with easier thighes</div>

      <div class='line in1'>Yet, howsoere, thus much my thoughts have scann’d,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>She’d come by water, had she come by land.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>So closed the golden days of Queen Elizabeth; leaving
us, in all the virtues and comforts of the world, the bankrupt
children of Queen Victoria!</p>

<p class='c010'>Unworthy is he of the balmy sweetness of this blessed
May who can think so! A churlish, foolish, moody
traitor to the spirit of goodness and beauty that, as with
the bounty of the sun and air, calls up forms of loveliness
in his path, and surrounds him with ten thousand household
blessings! With active presences, which the poet of
Elizabeth, in even <i>his</i> large love for man could scarce
have dreamed of; or, dreaming, seen them as a part of
fairy fantasy—a cloud-woven pageant!</p>

<p class='c010'>Let the man who lives by his daily sweat pause in his
toil, and, with his foot upon his spade, watch the white
smoke that floats in the distance; listen to the lessening
thunder of the engine that, instinct with Vulcanic life, has
rushed, devouring space, before it. That little curl of
smoke hangs in the air a thing of blessed promise—that
roar of the engine is the melody of hope to unborn generations.
But now, the digger of the soil looks moodily at
that vapour, and his heart is festering with the curse upon
the devil Steam; that fiend that grinds his bones beneath
the wheels of British Juggernaut. Poor creature! The
seeming demon is a beneficent presence that, in the ripeness
of time, will work regeneration of the hopes of men.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let the poor man—the mechanic of a town—look
around him. Let him in his own house, humble though
it be, acknowledge the presence of a thousand comforts
which, had he lived two centuries ago, he could not with
a baron’s wealth have purchased. Not mere creature
enjoyments; but humanizing, refining pleasures, drawing
man nearer to man, expanding the human heart, and
imparting to humanity the truest greatness in the greatest
gentleness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What!” it may be asked, “can you have the hardihood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>or the ignorance, to vaunt these days above the
days of Elizabeth? These days with famine throwing
the shuttle—with ignorance, wholly brutish, digging in the
pit—with gold, a monster all brain, and so the very worst
of monsters—dominating throughout the land, and crushing
the pulses of thousands within its hard, relentless grasp?
Would you not rather pray for a return of those merry,
merry days, when men were whipped, imprisoned, branded,
burnt, at little more than the mere will of Majesty, for
mere opinion—but who had, nevertheless, bacon and bread
and ale sufficient to the day?”</p>

<p class='c010'>No; we would go no step backward, but many in advance;
our faith still increasing in the enlarged sympathies of men;
in the reverence which man has learned and is still learning
to pay towards the nature of his fellow-men; in the deep
belief that whatever change may and <i>must</i> take place in the
social fabric—we have that spirit of wisdom and tolerance
(certainly <i>not</i> a social creature of the golden days) waxing
strong among us,—so strong that the fabric will be altered
and repaired brick by brick, and stone by stone. Meanwhile,
the scaffolding is fast growing up about it.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>THE LITTLE GREAT AND THE GREAT LITTLE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Extraordinary</span> is the mind of man! He sails in mid-air;
he compasseth the globe; he blunts the lightning; he
writeth <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Paradise Lost</i>, the <i>Principia</i>, and he chaineth
a flea by the leg. He maketh the strong elephant to bend
his joints, and he subdueth a flea, if not to “hew wood,”
at least to draw water. These, the later triumphs of the
human essence, are now on exhibition somewhere in that
long ark for modern monsters, Regent Street! Yes, the
“Industrious Fleas” at once delight and shame fashionable
idlers, sending them to their beds to ruminate on the sagacity
of the living world about them.</p>
<p class='c010'>We love a monster as much as ever did <i>Trinculo</i>; hence
we have been bitten; that is, we have made acquaintance
with the “Industrious Fleas.” Let us shortly enumerate
their separate capabilities. One flea, a fine muscular fellow,
worthy, did fairies die, to be mourning coach horse at the
funeral of Queen Titania (how long since the fairies had a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>coronation!), draws a very splendid carriage, constructed
from the pith of elder. He curvets, and bounds, and
shows his blood (he must have been fed in some royal
stable—he has surely fattened on kings) with the proudest
royal coach-horse, on—as they say at public dinners—“the
proudest day of its life.” Having seen its legs,
we shall think more seriously of the kick of a flea ever
after. Then, to talk of a “flea bite,” as a proverb for
a wife—a mere nothing; let those who speak thus vainly
contemplate the terrible proboscis of the aforesaid chariot
flea, and then think of the formidable weapon, plunged
through one’s tender skin, and sucking up by quarts (we
saw, we looked through a microscope) our hearts’ best
blood! To go to bed appears no wonder, but to be
able to rise again after what we have beheld, seems to
us a daily miracle! To proceed. Another of the “industrious”
takes the air with a chain and a weight to his
leg, the wonder consisting in its resignation to its destiny.
A third flea, also manacled, draws water. A fourth
flea has a more awful duty—to bear Napoleon Bonaparte,
late of France, but now of St Helena—there he is, the
victor of a hundred fights, majestically seated on flea back.
An enthusiastic Frenchman may, if he have good eyes, see
in the miniature emperor, the sallow, thoughtful face, the
“brassy eye” (<i>vide</i> Haydon’s account) of the original
despot—could the figure take snuff, the illusion would be
perfect. Two other fleas, soldiers, fight a desperate combat,
affording in their proper persons a triumphant refutation
to the celebrated dogma of the philosopher, that “fleas are
not lobsters.” We understood from the <i>Cicerone</i> that their
deadly enmity was excited towards each other by a mutual
tickling. We were also informed that one of the fleas
(“epicurean animal!”) had the honour to sup off the hand
of the Princess Augusta. This fact was shamefully hushed
up by the magas of the <i>Court Circular</i>, else how would it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>have astonished the world to have read that “last night Her
Royal Highness the Princess Augusta gave a supper to the
fleas!” Certain it is, the document contains at times news
of less interest.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c017'><sup>[8]</sup></a> This condescension on the part of her
Highness, though it speaks much for her affability, has been
the cause of grievous heartburnings and bickerings among
the society. It is extraordinary the airs that every flea
gives himself about “his blood.” However, it is to be
hoped that a herald will be appointed to settle the claims of
each disputant, and to favour the whole with a genealogical
tree. Who knows whether one of these fleas’ ancestors
did not bite Sancho Panza, or the Dulcinea del Toboso, or
the <i>Carters</i>, who were “bitten like a tench”? Speaking
on our own responsibility, we are afraid that each of these
little creatures, after all its vanity about pure blood, has been
somewhat capricious in its appetite; a fault, by the by, which
often puzzles the heralds in their labours, for certain other
little animals are very angry, when they speak of blood,
too.</p>

pace, with our long, lean visage bent towards the earth, we
were accosted by a man—an odd-looking person, with a
box at his back—who begged we would stop and see his
show. We were in a sight-seeing humour, and at once
consented. The box was placed on a trestle, our eye was
at the glass, and our ears open, when the man commenced
his description:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The first view presents you with a grand state coach of
the Great Mogul; it is drawn by a thousand curious
animals; they are, as you will perceive, very finely dressed
in rich harness, tall feathers, and flying ribbons; they come
and tie themselves to the coach, and feel it an honour to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>bridled; they snort, and caper, and kick mud into the eyes
of the bystanders.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The next view shows you one of these animals with a
long chain and a heavy log. This chain was fixed upon
his leg when he was born; and though he has sometimes
tried to file away the links, he has had his knuckles so
smartly rapped, and been called so many names—been so
preached to that the chain and log were for his own good,
and that it would ruin him to take them from him—that
’tis likely he will, for the public benefit, be made to wear
them to the end of his days.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The animal in the next view, that is chained and draws
water, is one of the Great Mogul’s million of slaves. Although
he draws bucket after bucketful for the Mogul’s
house and his household, for his horses and his dogs, and
his kitchen, and his flower garden, he is often perishing
himself for one half mouthful; his lips are blistered, and
his tongue black, with the water drawn by his own hands,
running about him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The fourth animal is mounted on a fiery dragon, that,
belching flames, kindles forests, fires towns, dries rivers,
blasts harvests, and swallows men, women, and sucking babes.
Look to the left, and the dragon is turned to a something
no bigger than a mouse, and with its stinted rations of
butter and cheese.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the fifth and last view you see ten thousand of these
animals ferociously killing, biting, tearing another ten
thousand, whom they never saw till a few minutes ago, and
with whom they have no quarrel. But they kill one another
because they are tickled to do so. That is, certain animals
go about with tickling wands called ‘glory,’ ‘deathless
renown,’ ‘laurel,’ and other titillating syllables, poking in
the ribs of the poor benighted creatures.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I took my eye from the glass: “My good man, what
have you shown me?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“Fleas, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fleas!—nonsense; the fleas are shown above.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir; but mine are the fleas with two legs; though,
<i>if</i> I must be honest, I can’t say I see any difference between
the fleas in my show-box and the fleas above.”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>THE MANAGER’S PIG</h2>
</div>
<p class='c023'>“Some people are not to be persuaded to taste of any creatures
they have daily seen and been acquainted with whilst they were
alive.... In this behaviour, methinks there appears something
like a consciousness of guilt; it looks as if they endeavoured
to save themselves from the imputation of a crime (which they
know sticks somewhere) by removing the cause of it as far as
they can from themselves.”—<span class='sc'>Mandeville.</span></p>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Aristides Tinfoil</span>, it is our fixed belief, was intended by
nature either for lawn sleeves or ermined robes; he was,
we doubt it not, sent into this world an embryo bishop, or
a lord-chief-justice <i>in posse</i>. Such, we are convinced, was
the benignant purpose of nature; but the cruel despotism of
worldly circumstance relentlessly crossed the fair design;
and Tinfoil, with a heart of honey and a head of iron, was
only a player—or, we should rather say, a master among
players. Tinfoil might have preached charity-sermons till
tears should have overflowed the pews; no matter, he acted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the benevolent old men to the sobs and spasms of a crowded
audience: he might, with singular efficacy, have passed
sentence of death on coiners and sheep-stealers; circumstances,
however, confined his mild reproofs to scene-shifters,
bill-stickers, Cupids at one shilling per night, and
white muslin Graces.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Where is Mr Moriturus?” asked Tinfoil, chagrined
at the untoward absence of his retainer. “Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Ill, Sir,” was the melancholy answer, “very ill.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Ill!” exclaimed Tinfoil, in a tone of anger, quickly
subsiding into mild remonstrance. “Ill!—why—why
doesn’t the good man <i>die at once</i>?”</p>

<p class='c019'>A pretty budding girl had, unhappily, listened to the
silvery tongue of a rival manager. “Take her from the
villain!” exclaimed Tinfoil to the sorrowing parent; “bring
her here, and then—then I’ll tell you what I’ll do.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Dear, kind Mr Tinfoil, what will you do!”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’ll bring her out, Sir—bring her out in—” and here
the manager named a play in which the horrors of seduction
are painted in bold colours for the indignant virtuous. “I’ll
bring her out in that, Sir, as a particular favour to you, and
sympathising as I must with the affliction you suffer, I—I
myself will play the injured father, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c019'>These, however, are but faint lines in the strongly-marked
character of Tinfoil, and merely displaying them
to awaken the attention of the reader to what we consider a
most triumphant piece of casuistry on the part of our hero—to
an incident which admits of so many hundred worldly
illustrations—we shall proceed to the pig. The subject,
we own, may appear unpromising from its extreme homeliness;
yet, as the precious bezoar is sought for in deer and
goats, so may a pearl of price be found even in a pig.</p>

<p class='c019'>It is our fervent wish to be most exact in every point of
this little history; yet cannot we remember the exact year
in which Tinfoil, revolving in his managerial mind the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>very many experiments made under his government on the
curiosity and sensibilities of the public, determined in a
golden moment, upon the introduction of a pig, in a drama
to be expressly written for the animal’s capacities. In the
slang of the craft, the pig was to be measured for his part.</p>

<p class='c019'>We cannot take it upon ourselves to avow, that an accident
of late occurrence to a brother actor, did not, at least
remotely, influence the choice of Tinfoil. The mishap
was this. A few miles from London—for the sake of
unborn generations we conceal the name of the town—the
dullard denizens had manifested an extraordinary apathy to
the delights of the drama. In the despairing words of one
of the sufferers, “nothing could move ’em.” However,
another of more sanguine temperament resolved to make a
last bold effort on their stubborn souls, and to such high
end, set a pig at them. Mingling the blandishments of the
lottery with the witcheries of the drama, he caused it to be
printed in boldest type to the townspeople of ——, that a
shower of little bits of paper would take place between
the play and farce, and amidst this shower a prize would
descend, conveying to the lucky possessor the entire property
of a real China-bred porker! Inconceivable as to us it is
the scheme failed—the pig remained live stock upon the
hands of the projector, who, the next morning, walked to
town; and recounting his adverse fortune to the calculating
Tinfoil, supplicated any employment.</p>

<p class='c019'>“And you still possess the pig? Humph!” mused Tinfoil;
“perhaps we may come to some arrangement.”</p>

<p class='c019'>In few words the applicant was admitted among Tinfoil’s
troop; the pig, at a nominal price, passing into the hands
of the manager.</p>

<p class='c019'>The pig was no sooner a member of the company than
the household author was summoned by Tinfoil, who, introducing
the man of letters to the porker, shortly intimated
that “he must write a part for him.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“For a pig, Sir?” exclaimed the author.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Measure him,” said Tinfoil, not condescending to
notice the astonishment of the dramatist.</p>

<p class='c019'>“But, my dear Sir, it is impossible that——”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Sir! impossible is a word which I cannot allow in my
establishment. By this time, Sir, you ought to know that
my will, Sir, is sufficient for all things, Sir—that, in a
word, Sir, there is a great deal of Napoleon about me, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c019'>We must admit that the dramatist ought not to have
forgotten this last interesting circumstance, Mr Tinfoil
himself very frequently recurring to it. Indeed, it was
only an hour before that he had censured the charwoman
for having squandered a whole sack of sawdust on the hall
floor, when half a sack was the allotted quantity. “He, Mr
Tinfoil, had said half a sack; and the woman knew, or
ought to know, there was a good deal of Napoleon about
him!” To return to the pig.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Measure him, Sir,” cried Mr Tinfoil, the deepening
tones growling through his teeth, and his finger pointing
still more emphatically downwards to the pig.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why,” observed the author, “if it could be measured,
perhaps——”</p>

<p class='c019'>“<i>If</i> it could! Sir,” and Mr Tinfoil, when at all excited,
trolled the monosyllable with peculiar energy—“Sir,
I wouldn’t give a straw for a dramatist who couldn’t
measure the cholera-morbus.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Much may be done for an actor by measuring,” remarked
the dramatist, gradually falling into the opinion of
his employer.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Everything, Sir! Good God! what might I not
have been had I condescended to be measured? Human
nature, Sir—the divine and glorious characteristic of our
common being, Sir—that is the thing, Sir—by heavens!
Sir, when I think of that great creature, Shakespeare, Sir,
and think that he never measured actors—no, Sir——”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“No, Sir,” acquiesced the dramatist.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Notwithstanding, Sir, we live in other times, Sir,
and you must write a part for the pig, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Very well, Sir; if he must be measured, Sir, he
must,” said the author.</p>

<p class='c019'>“It is a melancholy thing to be obliged to succumb to
the folly of the day,” remarked Mr Tinfoil, “and yet,
Sir, I could name certain people, Sir, who, by heavens!
Sir, would not have a part to their backs, Sir, if they had
not been measured for it, Sir. Let me see: it is not
three o’clock—well, some time to-night you’ll let me
have the piece for the pig, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Now whether the writer addressed was by his “so
potent art” enabled to measure a pig—to write a perfect
swinish drama in a few hours—or whether, knowing the
Buonapartean self-will of the manager, the dramatist
thought it wise to make no remonstrance, we cannot truly
discover: certain it is, with no objection made, he took his
leave.</p>

<p class='c019'>“An extraordinary young man, Sir—I have brought
him out, Sir—a wonderful young man, Sir,” observed Mr
Tinfoil to a friend and neighbour, a dealer in marine-stores.
“Only wants working, Sir—requires nothing but being
kept at it, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, it must be a puzzling trade,” remarked the dealer.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Puzzling, Sir! By heavens! Sir, my heart bleeds
for men of letters, Sir—they are great creatures, Sir—wonderful
natures, Sir—we cannot think too highly of
them, Sir—cannot sufficiently reward them, Sir! Now,
Sir, it is perfectly unknown my liberality towards that
young man! But then, Sir—it is my delight, Sir, when
I find real genius, Sir—when I meet with a man of
original mind, Sir—by heavens! Sir,” again cried Mr
Tinfoil, resorting to the exclamation as an outlet for his
overcharged feelings.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>The pig was duly measured—the piece prepared—and,
having been produced at enormous expense, was sealed with
the unqualified approbation of a discerning public.</p>

<p class='c019'>The pig-drama had been represented about twenty nights,
when the author of the piece, in friendly converse with his
patron manager, remarked “that the porker had been a
most profitable venture.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, Sir,” replied Mr Tinfoil, “tolerably well; but
the fact is, I am obliged to bolster him. He has had the
advantage of three new afterpieces, and therefore can’t
complain that he has been let down. Still, the pig has
done very well, and perhaps may run a fortnight more.”
Saying this Tinfoil quaffed from a brimming glass of his
chosen fluid.</p>

<p class='c019'>“At all events,” remarked the author, “the pig
possesses one advantage not to be found in any other of
your actors.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And what, Sir,” asked Mr Tinfoil, “what may
that be?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, after the pig has done his work, and the piece
is put by, you may eat the pig.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The manager started from the inhuman man of letters
with a look of mingled horror, disgust and pity. When
he had somewhat recovered from his amazement he asked
with evident loathing, “What did you say, Sir?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I said,” replied the insensible author, “that when the
pig had played out his part you might eat him.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr Tinfoil, gently stirring his brandy-and-water, fixed
an eye, like that of death-darting cockatrice, upon the
author, and after swallowing the liquor, and thereby somewhat
regaining his self-possession, he addressed the thoughtless
dramatist in words and tones that, as he has since
declared, can never cease to vibrate in his memory.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Sir!” thus spoke Mr Tinfoil. “I regret—much
regret, Sir, that anything in my conduct could have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>induced you, Sir, to think so uncharitably of my disposition,
Sir.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I assure you, Sir——”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Hear me out, Sir. What, Sir! think me capable of
feeding upon an animal that I have played with—a creature,
whose sagacity has almost made it my humble friend—a pig
that has eaten from my hand—that knows my voice—that
I—I eat that pig—good heavens, Sir!”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’m sure I didn’t mean——”</p>

<p class='c019'>“No, Sir,” cried Tinfoil, “not were I starving, Sir—not
were I famishing, Sir, could I be brought to taste that pig.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Much more did Mr Tinfoil deliver declaratory of his
horror at the bare idea of setting his teeth in the flesh
of his quadruped actor, and the rebuked man of letters
quitted the manager with an exalted notion of his sensibility.</p>

<p class='c019'>The pig-drama continued to be played to the increasing
satisfaction of the public; the audience, however, only
being admitted to view the professional abilities of the
animal; his suppers—from some extraordinary omission of
Tinfoil—not being eaten before the curtain. Great, however,
as was the success of the pig, at about the fortieth
night his prosperity began to wane—he was withdrawn, and
passed into oblivion.</p>

<p class='c019'>A few weeks had elapsed, and the author was summoned
to the dwelling of his manager, to write a play for a stud
of horses. Tinfoil was at dinner, whereto he courteously
invited his household scribe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You oughtn’t to refuse,” said one of the diners, “for
this,” and the speaker pointed to some pickled pork in the
dish, “this is an old friend of yours.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Good heavens!” exclaimed the dramatist, looking reproachfully
at Tinfoil. “Why, not the pig?”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tinfoil somewhat abashed coughed and nodded.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, you said that nothing on earth would tempt you
to eat that pig.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“No more it could, Sir,” cried the assured manager, “no,
Sir—no more it could—<i>unless salted</i>!”</p>

<p class='c019'>Of how many applications is this casuistry of the manager
susceptible?</p>

<p class='c019'>“When, Sir,” cried the pensioned patriot, “I swore
that no power in the universal world could make me accept
a favour at the hands of such men—I meant——”</p>

<p class='c019'>“<i>Unless salted!</i>”</p>

<p class='c019'>How often is it with men’s principles, as with the
manager’s pig; things inviolable, immutable—<i>unless salted</i>?</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>SOME ACCOUNT OF A STAGE DEVIL</h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>The</span> “principle of evil,” as commonly embodied in the
theatre, has been a sorry affair; the stage devil, in a word,
a shabby person. From the time of the mysteries at
Coventry to the melodramas of the phosphoric pen of the
blue-fire dramatists, the father of iniquity has made his
appearance in a manner more provocative of contempt than
of peace; a candidate for our smiles, rather than a thing
of terrors; we have chuckled where we should have
shuddered.</p>
<p class='c010'>That the stage devil should have been so commonplace
an individual, when there were devils innumerable where-from
an admirable selection of demons might be “constantly
on hand,” made it the more inexcusable on the part of
those gentlemen invested with the power of administering
to, and in some measure forming, public taste. What a
catalogue of devils may be found in the Fathers! Let us
particularise a few from the thousand of demons with
which the benevolent imaginations of our ancestors have
peopled the air, the earth, and the flood. Poor humanity
stands aghast at the fearful odds of spiritual influences
arrayed against it; for it is the fixed opinion of Paracelsus,
that “the air is not so full of flies in summer as it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>at all times of invisible devils”; whilst another philosopher
declares that there is “not so much as an hairbreadth
empty in earth or in water, above or under the earth!”
Cornelius Agrippa has carefully classified devils, making
them of nine orders. The first are the false Gods adored
at Delphos and elsewhere in various idols, having for their
captain Beelzebub; the second rank is of “liars and
equivocators,” as Apollo—poor Apollo!—“and the like”;
the third are “vessels of anger, inventors of all mischief,”
and their prince is Belial; the fourth are malicious, revengeful
devils, their chief being Asmodeus; the fifth
are cozeners, such as belong to magicians and witches,
their prince is Satan; the sixth are those aerial devils that
corrupt the air, and cause plagues, thunder, fire, and
tempests—Meresin is their prince; the seventh is a destroyer,
captain of the fairies; the eighth is an accusing
or calumniating devil; and the ninth are all these in
several kinds, their commander being Mammon. Of all
these infernal creatures Cornelius Agrippa writes, with the
confidence and seeming accuracy of a man favoured with
their most intimate acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c010'>In addition to these we have, on the authority of grave
philosophers, legions of household devils, from such as
“commonly work by blazing stars,” fire-drakes, or <i>ignes
fatui</i>, to those who “counterfeit suns and moons, and
oftentimes sit on ship masts.” Their common place of
rendezvous, when unemployed, is Mount Hecla. Cardon,
with an enviable gravity, declares that “his father had an
aerial devil bound to him for twenty and eight years.”
Paracelsus relates many stories, all authenticated, of she-devils,
“that have lived and been married to mortal men,
and so continued for certain years with them, and after
for some dislike have forsaken them.” Olaus Magnus—a
most delightful liar—has a narrative of “one Hotheius,
a king of Sweden, that, having lost his company as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>was hunting one day, met with these water-nymphs and
fairies, and was feasted by them”; and Hector Boethius
of “Macbeth and Banquo, two Scottish lords, that, as
they were wandering in the woods, had their fortune told
them by three strange women!” For the “good people,”
the wood-nymphs, foliots, fairies, they are, on the best
authority, to be seen in many places in Germany, “where
they do usually walk in little coats some two feet long.”
Subterranean devils are divided by Olaus Magnus into six
companies; they commonly haunt mines, “and the metal-men
in many places account it good luck, a sign of treasure
and rich ore, when they see them.” Georgius Agricola
(<i>de subterraneis animantibus</i>) reckons two more kinds, “that
are clothed after the manner of metal-men, and will do
their work.” Their office, according to the shrewd guess
of certain philosophers, “is to keep treasure in the earth
that it be not all at once revealed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>On the 20th of June 1484, it is upon record that the
devil appeared “at Hamond, in Saxony,” in the likeness
of a field-piper, and carried away a hundred and thirty
children “that were never after seen!” I might fill
folios with the pranks and malicious mummeries of the
evil spirit, all, too, duly attested by the most respectable
witnesses, but shall at once leave the demons of the
philosophers for the spirits of the playmongers, the devils
of the world for the devils of the stage.</p>

<p class='c010'>Why is it that, nine times out of ten, your stage devil
is a droll rather than a terrible creature? I suspect this
arises from the bravado of innate wickedness. We endeavour
to shirk all thoughts, all recollections of his
horrible attributes, by endowing him with grotesque propensities.
We strive to laugh ourselves out of our fears:
we make a mountebank of what is in truth our terror, and
resolutely strive to grin away our apprehensions. Surely
some feeling of this kind must be at the bottom of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>our ten thousand jokes at the devil’s expense—of the glee
and enjoyment with which the devil is received at the
theatre; where, until the appearance of Mr Wieland, he
had been but a commonplace absurdity, a dull repetition
of a most dull joke.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wieland has evidently studied the attributes of the evil
principle; with true German profundity, he has taken
their length, and their depth, and their breadth, he has
all the devil at his very finger ends, and richly deserves
the very splendid silver-gilt horns and tail (manufactured
by Rundell and Bridges) presented to him a few nights
since by the company at the English Opera-house; presented
with a speech from the stage-manager, which, or
I have been grossly misinformed, drew tears from the eyes
of the very scene-shifters.</p>

<p class='c010'>Can anybody forget Wieland’s devil in the <i>Daughter
of the Danube</i>? Never was there a more dainty bit of
infernal nature. It lives in my mind like one of Hoffman’s
tales, a realisation of the hero of the nightmare, a thing
in almost horrible affinity with human passions. How he
eyed the Naiades, how he laughed and ogled, and faintingly
approached, then wandered round the object of his
demoniacal affections! And then how he burst into
action! How he sprang, and leapt, and whirled, and,
chuckling at his own invincible nature, spun like a teetotum
at the sword of his baffled assailant! And then his
yawn and sneeze! There was absolute poetry in them—the
very highest poetry of the ludicrous: a fine imagination
to produce such sounds as part of the strange, wild, grotesque
phantom—to give it a voice that, when we heard it, we
felt to be the only voice such a thing could have. There
is fine truth in the devils of Wieland. We feel that
they live and have their being in the realms of fancy;
they are not stereotype commonplaces, but most rare and
delicate monsters, brought from the air, the earth, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>the flood; and wherever they are from, bearing in them
the finest characteristics of their mysterious and fantastic
whereabouts.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wieland’s last devil, in an opera bearing his fearful name,
is not altogether so dainty a fellow as his elder brother of
the Danube, whose melancholy so endeared him to our
sympathies, whose lackadaisical demeanour so won upon
our human weakness. In <i>The Devil’s Opera</i> the hero is
more of the pantomimist than of the thinking creature; he
is not contemplative, but all for action; he does not, like
the former fiend, retire into the fastness of his infernal mind
to brood on love and fate, but is incessantly grinning, leaping,
tumbling; hence he is less interesting to the meditative
part of the audience, though, possibly, more attractive to
the majority of playgoers, who seem to take the “evil
principle” under their peculiar patronage, laughing, shouting,
and hurrahing at every scurvy trick played by it on
poor, undefended humanity; though, with a bold aim of
genius on the part of the author, the devil, in the opera, is
made the ally of love and virtue against blind tyranny and
silly superstition. The devil is changed, bound, the bond-slave
of the good and respectable part of the <i>dramatis personae</i>,
to the confusion of the foolish and the wicked. This
is certainly putting the “evil principle” to the very first
advantage. The best triumph of the highest benevolence
is, undoubtedly, to turn the dominating fiend into the toiling
vassal, and in the new opera this glory is most unequivocally
achieved.</p>

<p class='c010'>To Wieland we are greatly indebted for having reformed
the “infernal powers” of the theatre; for having rescued
the imp of the stage from the vulgar commonplace character
in which he has too long distinguished himself, or, I ought
rather to say, exposed himself; for there was no mystery
whatever in him: he was a sign-post devil, a miserable
daub, with not one of those emanations of profound, unearthly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>thought—not the slightest approach to that delicacy
of colouring, that softening of light into shade, and shade
into light, that distinguish the devil of Wieland. No: in
him we have the foul fiend divested of all his vulgar,
Bartlemy Fair attributes; his horns, and tail, and saucer-eyes,
and fish-hook nails, are the least part of him; they
are the mere accidents of his nature, not his nature itself;
we have the devil in the abstract, and are compelled to
receive with some consideration the popular and charitable
proverb that declares him to be not quite so black as
limners have shadowed him.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the rarest accident I have obtained some account of
the birth and childhood of Wieland. It appears that he is
a German born, being the youngest of six sons of Hans
Wieland, a poor and most amiable doll-maker, a citizen
of Hildesheim. When only four years old the child was
lost in the Hartz Mountains, whither his father and several
neighbours had resorted to make holiday. The child had
from his cradle manifested the greatest propensities towards
the ludicrous; it was his delight to place his father’s dolls
in the most preposterous positions, doing this with a seriousness,
a gravity, in strange contrast with his employment.
It was plain to Professor Teufelskopf, a frequent visitor at
the shop of old Wieland, employed by the professor on toys
that are yet to astound the world—being no other than a
man and wife and four children, made entirely out of pear-tree,
and yet so exquisitely constructed, as to be enabled to
eat and drink, cry, and pay taxes, with a punctuality and
propriety not surpassed by many machines of flesh and
blood—I say it was the opinion of Professor Teufelskopf
that young Wieland was destined to play a great part among
men, an opinion we are happy to say nightly illustrated by
the interesting subject of this memoir. We have, however,
to speak of his adventures when only four years old, in the
Hartz Mountains. For a whole month was the child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>missing, to the agony of its parents, and the deep regret of
all the citizens of Hildesheim, with whom little George
was an especial favourite. The mountains were overrun
by various parties in search of the unfortunate little vagrant,
but with no success. It was plain that the boy had been
caught away by some spirit of the mines with which the
marvellous districts abound, or, it might be, carried to the
very height of the Brockenberg, by the king of the mountains,
to be his page and cup-bearer. The gravest folks of
the Hildesheim shook their heads, and more than two
declared that they never thought George would grow up
to be a man—he was so odd, so strange, so fantastic, so
unlike any other child. The despair of Hans Wieland
was fast settling into deep melancholy, and he had almost
given up all hope, when, as he sat brooding at his fireside
one autumn night, his wife—she had quitted him not a
minute to go upstairs—uttered a piercing shriek. Hans
rushed from the fireside, and in an instant joined his wife,
who, speechless with delight and wonder, pointed to the
nook in the chamber where little George was wont to sleep,
and where, at the time, but how brought there was never,
never known, the boy lay in the profoundest slumber; in
all things the same plump, good-looking child, save that his
cheek was more than usually flushed. Hans Wieland and
his wife fell upon their knees and sobbed thanksgivings.</p>

<p class='c010'>I cannot dwell upon the effect produced by this mysterious
return of the child upon the people of Hildesheim.
The shop of Hans Wieland was thronged with folks anxious
to learn from the child himself a full account of his wanderings,
of how he happened to stray away, of what he had
seen, and by what means he had been brought back. To
all these questions, though on other points a most docile
infant, George maintained the most dogged silence, several
of the church authorities, half a dozen professors, nay, the
great Teufelskopf himself, questioned the child; but all in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>vain, George was resolutely dumb. It was plain, however,
that he had been the playfellow, the pet of supernatural
beings; and though there can be but little doubt that his
friends and devils as shown upon the stage are no other
than faithful copies of the grotesque originals at this moment
sporting in the neighbourhood of the Brockenberg, Mr
Wieland, as I am credibly informed, though a gentle and
amiable person in other respects, is apt to be ruffled, nay,
violent, if impertinently pressed upon the subject of his
early wanderings. When, however, we reflect upon the
great advantages obtained by Mr Wieland from what is
now to be considered the most fortunate accident of his
childhood, we must admit that there is somewhat less praise
due to him than if he appeared before us as a great original.
Since I have commenced this paper, I have been informed
by Mr Dullandry, of <i>The Wet Blanket</i>, that the goblin in
<i>The Daughter of the Danube</i>, a touch of acting in which
Mr Wieland gathered a wreath of red-hot laurels, is by no
means what it was taken for, a piece of fine invention on
the part of the actor, but an imitation, a most servile copy
of the real spirit that carried George away from his father
and friends, tempting the little truant with a handful of the
most delicious black cherries, and a draught of kirschen-wasser.
That every gesture, every movement, nay, that
the leer of the eye and the “villainous hanging of the nether
lip,” the sneeze, the cough, the sigh, the lightning speed, the</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>Infernal</i> beauty, melancholy grace,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c026'>all the attributes of mind and body of that most delicate
fiend of the Brockenberg, were given in the hobgoblin of
the Danube. Hence, if Mr Wieland be not, as we thought
him, a great original, he is most assuredly the first of
mimics, and has turned a peril of his childhood to a golden
purpose. Dullandry declares upon the best authority—doubtless
his own—that the devil of the Brockenberg, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>little George cried to go home to his father and mother,
his brother and sister, would solace the child by playing
upon a diabolic fiddle, the strings of wolf’s gut and the
bow-string from the snowy hair of the witch of the Alps,
dancing the while, and by the devilish magic of the music
bringing from every fissure in the rocks, every cleft in the
earth, and from every stream, their supernatural intelligences
to caper and make holiday, for the especial delight of the
poor, kidnapped son of the doll-maker of Hildesheim.
If this be true, and when Dullandry speaks it is hard to
doubt, his words being pearls without speck or flaw—if
this be true, we here beg leave to inform Mr Wieland that
from this minute we withdraw from him a great part of that
admiration with which we have always remembered the
spasmodic twitch of his elbow, the self-complacency about
his eyes and jaws, the lofty look of conscious power, the
stamping of the foot, and the inexhaustible energy of <i>bowing</i>
which marked his <i>Devil on Two Sticks</i>, all such graces
and qualifications being, as from Dullandry, it now appears,
the original property of the devil of the Brockenberg. However,
to return to our narrative, which, as I am prepared to
show, has in these days of daring speculation the inestimable
charm of truth to recommend it to the severest attention
of my readers.</p>
<p class='c010'>Little George remained a marvel to the good citizens of
Hildesheim, few of whom, for certain prudential reasons,
would any longer permit their children to play with him;
fearing, and reasonably enough, some evil from contact with
a child who was evidently a favourite with the spirits of the
Hartz Mountains. However, this resolution had no effect on
George, who more than ever indulged in solitary rambles, becoming
day by day more serious and taciturn. His little head—as
Professor Teufelskopf sagaciously observed—was filled
with the shapes and shadows haunting the Brockenberg.
Many were the solicitations made by Teufelskopf and rival
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>professors to Hans Wieland, to be permitted to take little
George and educate him for a philosopher, an alchemist, in
fact for anything and everything, the boy displaying
capacities, as all declared, only to be found in an infant
Faust. To all these prayers Hans Wieland was deaf. He
resolved to bring up his son to the honest and useful employment
of doll-making; keeping, if possible, his head from
the cobwebs and dust of the schools, and making him a
worthy minister to the simple and innocent enjoyments of
baby girls,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c017'><sup>[9]</sup></a> rather than consenting to his elevation as a
puzzler and riddler among men. Thus our hero, denied to
the scholastic yearnings of the great Teufelskopf, sat at home,
articulating the joints of dolls, and helping to make their
eyes open and shut, when—had his father the true worthy
ambition in him—the boy would have been inducted into
knowledge that might have given him supernatural power
over living flesh and blood, bending and binding it to his
own high, philosophic purposes. Hans Wieland, however,
was a simple, honest soul, with a great, and, therefore,
proper sense of the beauties and uses of the art of doll-making.
Glad also am I to state that little George, with all
his dreaminess, remained a most dutiful, sweet-tempered boy;
and might be seen, seven hours at least out of the twenty-four,
seated on a three-legged stool fitting the arms and
legs of the ligneous hopes of the little girls of Hildesheim,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>his thoughts, it may be, far, far away with the fiddling
goblin of the Brockenberg, making holiday with the
multitude of spirits in the Hartz Mountains.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f9'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One of the most touching instances of the “maternal instinct,”
as it has been called, in children, came under my notice a few
months ago. A wretched woman, with an infant in her arms,
mother and child in very tatters, solicited the alms of a nursery-maid
passing with a child, clothed in the most luxurious manner,
hugging a large wax doll. The mother followed the girl, begging
for relief “to get bread for her child,” whilst the child itself,
gazing at the treasure in the arms of the baby of prosperity, cried,
“Mammy, when will you buy me a doll?” I have met with few
things more affecting than the contrast of the destitute parent
begging her bread (the misery seemed real) and the beggar’s
child begging of its mother for a “doll!”</p>
</div>
<div id='i113'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i113.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“Would solace the child by playing upon a diabolic fiddle”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c009'>This mental abstraction on the part of little George was
but too often forced upon the observation of the worthy
Hans, the young doll-maker constantly giving the looks and
limbs of hobgoblins to the faces and bodies of dolls, intended
by the father to supply the demand for household dolls of
the same staid and prudish aspect, of the same proportion of
members, as the dolls that had for two hundred years
soothed and delighted the little maidens of Hildesheim.
It is a fact hitherto unknown in England, that in the
Museum of Hildesheim—a beautiful, though somewhat
heavy building of the Saxon order—there are either eleven
or twelve (I think twelve) demon dolls made by young
Wieland, and to this day shown to the curious—though the
circumstance has, strangely enough, remained unnoticed by
the writers of Guide Books—as faithful portraits of the
supernatural inhabitants of the Hartz Mountains. I am
told, however, that within the last three years, one of the
figures has been removed into a separate chamber, and is
only to be seen by an express order from the town council,
in consequence of its lamentable effects on the nerves of a
certain German princess, who was so overcome by the exhibition,
that it was very much feared by the whole of the
principality—extending in territory at least a mile and a
quarter, and containing no less than three hundred and
twenty subjects—the territory would pass to a younger
brother, or, what is worse, be the scene of a frightful revolution,
an heir direct being wanted to consolidate the dynasty.
This unfortunate event, though, possibly, fatal to the future
peace of the said principality, is nevertheless a striking instance
of the powerful imagination or rather of the retentive
memory of the young Wieland. The doll, like all the
others, is a true copy from diabolic life. How the painful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>story attached to it should have escaped all the foreign
correspondents of all the newspapers is a matter of surpassing
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have now arrived at an important change in the life
of our hero. His father had received a munificent order
for three dolls from Prince Gotheoleog, a great patron of
the fine arts in all their many branches. The dolls were
intended by the prince—he was the best and most indulgent
of fathers—as presents for his daughters; and, therefore,
no pains, no cost, were to be spared upon them. After a
lapse of three months the order was completed; and young
Wieland, then in his seventh year, was dressed in his holiday
suit, and—the dolls being carried by Peter Shnicht, an
occasional assistant of Hans Wieland—he took his way to
the palace of the prince. It was about half-past twelve
when he arrived there, and the weather being extremely
sultry, George sat down upon the palace steps to rest and
compose himself before he ventured to knock at the gate.
He had remained there but a short time, when he was
addressed by a tall, majestic-looking person clothed in a
huntsman’s suit, and carrying a double-barrel gun, a weapon
used in the neighbourhood of Hildesheim in boar-shooting,
who, asking our hero his name and business, was struck with
the extraordinary readiness of the boy’s answers, and, more
than all, with a certain look of diabolic reverence peeping from
his eyes, and odd smiles playing about his mouth. The
stranger knocked at the gate, gave his gun to a servant, and
bade the little doll-maker follow the domestic, who showed
him into a sumptuous apartment. The reader is prepared
to find in the man with the gun no other person than Prince
Gotheoleog himself, who in a few minutes reappeared to
George, asked him in the most condescending manner
various questions respecting his proficiency in reading and
writing, and finally dismissed him with ten groschen for his
extraordinary intelligence. Six months after this Prince
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Gotheoleog was appointed ambassador to the court of St
James’s, and young Wieland attended him in the humble,
yet most honourable capacity of page. This appointment
Hans Wieland, in his simplicity, believed would effectually
win his romantic son from his errant habits, would cure him
of day-dreaming, by plunging his neck deep into the affairs
of this world. Alas! it had precisely the reverse effect
upon the diplomatic doll-maker. From the moment that
he found himself associated, though in the slightest degree,
with politics, the latent desire to play the devil burst forth
with inextinguishable ardour. A sense of duty—a filial
regard for the prejudices of his father—did for a time restrain
him from throwing up his very lucrative and most
promising situation in the household of Prince Gotheoleog,
and kept him to the incessant toil, unmitigated drudgery of
diplomatic life; but having one luckless night gained admission
into the gallery of the House of Commons on the
debate of a certain question, to which I shall not more
particularly allude, and there having seen and heard a certain
member, whose name I shall not specify, sway and convulse
the senate, George resolved from that moment to play the
devil, and nothing but the devil, to the end of his days.
He immediately retired to Bellamy’s, and penned his resignation
to Prince Gotheoleog, trusting, with the confidence
of true genius, to fortune, to his own force of character,
or, what is more likely, without once thinking of the means
or accidents, to obtain the end of his indomitable aspirations—an
appearance as the devil. Unrivalled as Wieland is
as the representative of the fiend in all his thousand shapes—to
be sure the great advantages of our hero’s education in
the Hartz Mountains are not to be forgotten—it is yet to
be regretted that he ever</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To the playhouse gave up what was meant for mankind.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c026'>It is, and must ever be, a matter of sorrow not only to his
best wishers, but to the friends of the world at large, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>those high qualifications, those surpassing powers of diabolic
phlegm, vivacity and impudence, which have made Mr
Wieland’s devils the <i>beau idéal</i> of the infernal, had not been
suffered to ripen in the genial clime of diplomacy. In the
full glow of my admiration of his diabolic beauties—that is,
since the facts above narrated have been in my possession—I
have often scarcely suppressed a sigh to think how great
an ambassador has been sacrificed in a play-house fiend.
Indeed, nothing can be more truly diplomatic than the
supernatural shifts of Wieland. Had he acted in France,
in the days of Napoleon, he had been kidnapped from the
stage, and, <i>nolens volens</i>, made a plenipotentiary.</p>
<p class='c010'>It is a painful theme to dwell upon the strugglings of
modest, and, consequently, unsupported genius. Therefore
I shall, at least for the present, suppress a very long and
minute account of the trials that beset our hero in his
attempts to make known the wonders that were in him.
I shall not relate how he was flouted by one manager,
snubbed by another, derisively smiled upon by a third;
how, at length, he obtained a footing in a theatre, but was
condemned to act the minor iniquities, less gifted men being
promoted to play the devil himself. In all these trials,
however, in all these disappointments and occasional heartburnings,
the genius of our hero continued to ripen. His
horns still budded, and his tail gave token of great promise;
and, at length, he burst upon the town, from top to toe,
<i>intus et in cute</i>, a perfect and most dainty devil. Great as
his success has been, I should not have thus lengthily dwelt
upon it, were I not convinced of its future increase. There
are grand mysteries in Wieland—part of his infant wanderings
in the Hartz—yet to be revealed. I feel certain from
the demoniacal variety of his humour, that there are a legion
of spirits, fantastic and new, yet to be shown to us; all of
them the old acquaintance of our hero’s babyhood, all from
the same genuine source of romance as his <i>Devil on Two</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span><i>Sticks</i>, his <i>Devil of the Danube</i>, and his <i>Devil of the
Opera</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having discussed the professional merits of Mr Wieland,
the reader may probably feel curious respecting the private
habits of a man so distinguished by his supernatural emotions.
I am enabled, it is with considerable satisfaction I avow it,
to satisfy the laudable anxiety of the reader, and from the
same authentic materials that have supplied the principal
part of this notice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Wieland is a gentleman of the most retired and
simple manners. After the severest rehearsals of a new
devil he has been known to recreate himself in the enclosure
of St James’s Park; and further, to illustrate his contemplative
and benevolent habits, by flinging to the various
water-fowl in the canal—by-the-way, in imitation of a
great regal authority—fragments of cake and biscuits. His
dress is of the plainest kind, being commonly a snuff-coloured
coat buttoned up to the neck; a white cravat, drab small-clothes,
and drab knee-gaiters. A gold-headed cane, said
to have been in the possession of Cornelius Agrippa, is
sometimes in his hand. He is occasionally induced to take
a pinch of snuff, but was never seen to smoke. His face is
as well known at the British Museum as are the Elgin
Marbles, Mr Wieland having for some years been employed
on a new edition of the <i>Talmud</i>. Although a German by
birth, Mr Wieland speaks English with remarkable purity,
having had the advantage of early instruction in our language
from a British dramatist, who, driven from the stage by the
invasion of French pieces, sought to earn his precarious
bread as a journeyman doll-maker with Mr Wieland,
senior. We could enter into further particulars, but shall
commit a violence upon ourselves, and here wind up what
we trust will henceforth prove a model for all stage
biographers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The inquiring reader may possibly desire to learn how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>we became possessed of the valuable documents from which
the above narrative is gathered. To this we boldly make
answer; we blush not, while we avow, that our dear friend
Dullandry has a most careless habit of carrying his most
valuable communications for <i>The Wet Blanket</i> in his coat
pocket; and that only on Thursday last we overtook him,
with his papers peeping from their sanctuary, when—when,
in a word, the temptation was too much for us, and the
consequence is, that the reader has “some account of a
stage devil.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Why should all dramatic truths be confined to the impartial
and original pages of <i>The Wet Blanket</i>?</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c003'>ST DOLLY</h3>

<p class='c026'><span class='sc'>At</span> an early age St Dolly showed the sweetness of her
nature by her tender love for her widowed father, a baker,
dwelling at Pie Corner, with a large family of little children.
It chanced that with bad harvests bread became so dear
that, of course, bakers were ruined by high prices. The
miller fell upon Dolly’s father, and swept the shop with his
golden thumb. Not a bed was left for the baker or his
little ones. St Dolly slept upon a flour sack, having prayed
that good angels would help her to help her father. Now
sleeping, she dreamt that the oven was lighted, and she
felt falling in a shower about her raisins, currants, almonds,
lemon peel, flour, with heavy drops of brandy. Then in
her dreams she saw the fairies gather up the things that fell
and knead them into a cake. They put the cake into the
oven, and dancing round and round, the fairies vanished,
crying, “<i>Draw the cake, Dolly—Dolly, draw the cake!</i>”
And Dolly awoke and drew the cake, and, behold, it was
the first twelfth cake, sugared at the top, and bearing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>images of Faith, Hope, and Charity. Now this cake, shown
in the window, came to the king’s ear; and the king bought
the cake, knighted the baker, and married Dolly to his
grand falconer, to whom she proved a faithful and loving
wife, bearing him a baker’s dozen of lovely children.</p>
<h3 class='c003'>ST PATTY</h3>

<p class='c012'>St Patty was an orphan, and dwelt in a cot with a sour
old aunt. It chanced, it being bitter cold, that three hunters
came and craved for meat and drink. “Pack!” said the
sour aunt, “neither meat nor drink have ye here.”
“Neither meat nor drink,” said Patty; “but something
better.” And she ran and brought some milk, some eggs,
and some flour, and, beating them up, poured the batter in
the pan. Then she took the pan and tossed the cake over;
and then a robin alighted at the window, and kept singing
these words—<i>One good turn deserves another</i>. And Patty
tossed and tossed the cakes; and the hunters ate their fill and
departed. And next day the hunter-baron came in state to
the cot; and trumpets were blown, and the heralds cried—<i>One
good turn deserves another</i>; in token whereof Patty became
the baron’s wife, and pancakes were eaten on Shrove
Tuesday ever after.</p>
<h3 class='c003'>ST NORAH</h3>

<p class='c012'>St Norah was a poor girl, and came to England to service.
Sweet-tempered and gentle, she seemed to love everything
she spoke to. And she prayed to St Patrick that he would
give her a good gift that would make her not proud but
useful: and St Patrick, out of his own head, taught
St Norah <i>how to boil a potato</i>. A sad thing, and to be
lamented, that the secret has come down to so few.</p>
<h3 class='c003'>ST BETSY</h3>

<p class='c012'>St Betsy was wedded to a knight who sailed with
Raleigh and brought home tobacco; and the knight smoked.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>But he thought that St Betsy, like other fine ladies of the
court, would fain that he should smoke out of doors, nor
taint with ’bacco-smoke the tapestry. Whereupon the
knight would seek his garden, his orchard, and in any
weather smoke <i>sub Jove</i>. Now it chanced as the knight
smoked St Betsy came to him and said, “My lord, pray
ye come into the house.” And the knight went with St
Betsy, who took him into a newly-cedared room, and said,
“I pray, my lord, henceforth smoke here: for is it not a
shame that you, who are the foundation and the prop of
your house, should have no place to put your head into
and smoke?” And St Betsy led him to a chair, and with
her own fingers filled him a pipe; and from that time the
knight sat in the cedar chamber and smoked his weed.</p>
<h3 class='c003'>ST PHILLIS</h3>

<p class='c012'>St Phillis was a virgin of noble parentage, but withal as
simple as any shepherdess of curds and cream. She
married a wealthy lord, and had much pin-money. But
when other ladies wore diamond and pearls, St Phillis only
wore a red and white rose in her hair. Yet her pin-money
brought the best of jewellery in the happy eyes of
the poor about her. St Phillis was rewarded. She lived
until fourscore, and still carried the red and white rose in
her face, and left their fragrance in her memory.</p>
<h3 class='c003'>ST PHŒBE</h3>

<p class='c012'>St Phœbe was married early to a wilful, but withal a
good-hearted husband. He was a merchant, and would
come home sour and sullen from ’change. Whereupon,
after much pondering, St Phœbe in her patience set to
work and, praying the while, made of dyed lambswool a
door-mat. And it chanced from that time, that never
did the husband touch that mat that it didn’t clean his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>temper with his shoes, and he sat down by his Phœbe as
mild as the lamb whose wool he had trod upon. Thus
gentleness may make miraculous door-mats!</p>
<h3 class='c003'>ST SALLY</h3>

<p class='c012'>St Sally, from her childhood, was known for her inner-most
love of truth. It was said of her that her heart was
in a crystal shrine, and all the world might see it. Moreover,
when other women denied, or strove to hide their age,
St Sally said, “I am five-and-thirty.” Whereupon next
birthday St Sally’s husband, at a feast of all their friends,
gave her a necklace of six-and-thirty opal beads; and on
every birthday added a bead, until the beads mounted to
four-score and one. And the beads seemed to act as a
charm; for St Sally, wearing the sum of her age about her
neck, age never appeared in her face. Such, in the olden
time, was the reward of simplicity and truth.</p>
<h3 class='c003'>ST BECKY</h3>

<p class='c012'>A very good man was St Becky’s husband, but with his
heart a little too much in his bottle. Port wine—red port
wine—was his delight, and his constant cry was—bee’s-wing.
Now as he sat tipsy in his arbour, a wasp dropped
into his glass, and the wasp was swallowed, stinging the
man inwardly. Doctors crowded, and with much ado the
man’s life was saved. Now St Becky nursed her husband
tenderly to health, and upbraided him not; but she said
these words, and they reformed him:—“<i>My dear, take
wine, and bless your heart with it—but wine in moderation:
else, never forget that the bee’s wing of to-day becomes the
wasp’s sting of to-morrow.</i>”</p>
<h3 class='c003'>ST LILY</h3>

<p class='c012'>St Lily was the wife of a poor man, who tried to support
his family—and the children were many—by writing books.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>But in those days it was not as easy for a man to find a
publisher as to say his paternoster. Many were the books
that were written by the husband of St Lily; but to every
book St Lily gave at least two babes. However, blithe as
the cricket was the spirit that ruled about the hearth of St
Lily. And how she helped her helpmate! She smiled
sunbeams into his ink bottle, and turned his goose pen to
the quill of a dove! She made the paper he wrote on as
white as her name, and as fragrant as her soul. And when
folks wondered how St Lily managed so lightly with fortune’s
troubles, she always answered, that she never heeded them,
for <i>troubles were like babies, and only grew the bigger by
nursing</i>.</p>
<h3 class='c003'>ST FANNY</h3>

<p class='c012'>St Fanny was a notable housewife. Her house was a
temple of neatness. Kings might have dined upon her
staircase! Now her great delight was to provide all things
comfortable for her husband, a hard-working merchant,
much abroad, but loving his home. Now one night he
returned tired and hungry, and, by some mischance, there
was nothing for supper. Shops were shut; and great was
the grief of St Fanny. Taking off a bracelet of seed pearl
she said, “<i>I’d give this ten times over for a supper for my
husband.</i>” And every pearl straightway became an oyster,
and St Fanny opened—the husband ate—and lo! in every
oyster was a pearl as big as a hazel nut; and so was St
Fanny made rich for life.</p>
<h3 class='c003'>ST FLORENCE OR ST NIGHTINGALE</h3>

<p class='c012'>St Florence, by her works, had her lips blessed with
comforting, and her hands touched with healing; and she
crossed the sea, and built hospitals, and solaced, and
restored. And so long as English mistletoe gathers
beneath it truthful hearts, and English holly brightens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>happy eyes, so long will Englishmen, at home or abroad,
on land or on the wave—so long, in memory of that Eastern
Christmas, will they cry—<i>God bless St Florence! Bless St
Nightingale!</i></p>
<h3 class='c003'>ST JENNY</h3>

<p class='c012'>St Jenny was wedded to a very poor man; they had
scarcely bread to keep them; but Jenny was of so sweet a
temper that even want bore a bright face, and Jenny always
smiled. In the worst seasons Jenny would spare crumbs
for the birds, and sugar for the bees. Now it so happened
that one autumn a storm rent their cot in twenty places
apart; when, behold, between the joists, from the basement
to the roof, there was nothing but honeycomb and honey—a
little fortune for St Jenny and her husband, in honey.
Now some said it was the bees, but more declared it was
the sweet temper of St Jenny that had filled the poor man’s
house with honey.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CAT-AND-FIDDLE MORALITIES<br /> <br />The Tale of a Tiger</h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>For</span> fifteen years had the large wooden arm-chair of the
Cat-and-Fiddle been consecrated to the use of Captain
Bam. He would sit in it as it were a throne; and the
customary guests of the hostelry paid him affectionate
loyalty. He had won all hearts by his odd, kind ways;
he had become the familiar oracle of all by his strange,
yet wise sayings. He had, too, the rare and happy knack
of so mixing his wisdom with his drollery, that when men
laughed and swallowed his jest, they also, like children
cheated with sweetened physic, swallowed something that
in proper season would do them hearty good. And then
there was a mystery about Captain Bam; and, at times,
mystery is a sort of sauce to human character. It will now
and then give a strange relish to what without it would be
insipid commonplace. Not that it was so with Captain Bam.
Certainly not; but the mystery was this. Fifteen years
before—on a sharp, wintry afternoon—he crossed the threshold
of the Cat-and-Fiddle. He carried a small leathern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>pack, and appeared otherwise appointed for a long pilgrimage.
It was, we say, sharp, blighting weather, and Captain Bam
called hastily for a mug of ale. “A mug of ale, and
directly,” said Captain Bam, “for I can’t stop a minute.”
The ale was brought, and the Captain hastily took a long
draught thereof. He then drew his breath, and a smile as
from the very roots of his heart broke over his face, and
his eye strangely glimmered and twinkled upon the landlord.
“<i>Eureka!</i>” said Captain Bam, and the host looked.
“<i>Eureka!</i>” again exclaimed the Captain. “Take my
pack,” he said, in a voice trembling with the fulness of
satisfaction, “take my pack—I will rest here.”</p>
<p class='c010'>And Captain Bam—his pack removed—sank in the large
arm-chair. It seemed that his travels were ended; that, in
a happy moment, he had accomplished the purpose of his
life; that all his future existence would be an appointed
state of rest. There was a little wooden nook—a sort of
summer-house, at the end of a long garden—which, after
few words, he hired of the host; whence every night he
came to bestow his talk upon the guests of the Cat-and-Fiddle.
“And how he would talk! Ha! better than a
printed book.” Such was the oft avowed opinion of his
gladdened hearers. And now the Captain is dead. His
body lies in the churchyard of the market town, but two
miles distant from the Cat-and-Fiddle. He had himself
written his epitaph. It is a model of brief simplicity—enough
to bring a blush into the cheek of many a stone-faced
cherub. The epitaph has only one word: it is this:
“<span class='sc'>Bam.</span>”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Captain died, but not his stories. No; there sat
every night in the fireside corner of the Cat-and-Fiddle an
ardent, passionate lover of the mind of Bam. He was a
silent Pylades—a mute Pythias. He would sit and store
himself with the syllables of Bam; then, like the bee,
would he fly rejoicing home, and ere he slept hive the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>wisdom in enduring ink. That wisdom is now before us.
The little vellum-bound book, its pages finely written as
with the point of a needle, lies upon our desk. Upon the
forehead of its title-page there are these words, “<span class='sc'>Cat-and-Fiddle
Moralities</span>”; touchingly recollectful of the genial
haunt where their fine wisdom was audible.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are—no, we will not tell the number of stories
enshrined in this little book. But from time to time we
will lay one before the reader, in what we believe to be the
very words of Bam.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes: we will begin with the first. Here it is—the title
beautifully engrossed, from which we guess the legal
yearnings of the chronicler—here it is.</p>
<h3 class='c003'>THE TALE OF A TIGER</h3>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps, my friends, you have never heard of a place
called Singapore. Well, it’s no matter if you haven’t. It’s
a long, long way east, where all sorts of shipping trade, and
where all sorts of people live—Chinamen, Malays, Javanese,
Bengalees, English, Dutch, and what not. Well, there was
at Singapore a certain Dutch family in the pepper trade.
They were named Vandervermin. They were all rich,
cautious, heavy people; all save Jacob Vandervermin, who
when a mere youth was left a poor orphan; left, as it might
have seemed, on purpose to exercise the loving benevolence
of prosperous uncles and aunts, and flourishing cousins.
Alas! the whole body of the Vandervermins considered the
poverty of Jacob as a blight—a family reproach; a nuisance
that every one sought to put off upon the other. Jacob
was the little toe of clay that disgraced the Vandervermin
body of brass. And what made him worse, he was, for
one with Dutch blood in his veins, a sprightly, frolicsome
fellow. He was a beggar, and yet, with a stony hardness of
heart—as Peter Vandervermin, the head of the family,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>declared—he would laugh and make offensive jokes upon
his wretchedness. There are men who cannot understand
a joke, simply because it is a thing that carries no worth
with it in a ledger. Now Peter Vandervermin received a
joke—especially the joke of a poor man—as an offence to
his judgment and a sidelong sneer at his pocket. His wife,
Drusilla Vandervermin, was of the same belief; and in this
goodly creed man and wife had reared a numerous family.
Jacob Vandervermin was the only outcast of the name who
had ever disgraced it by a jest. It was plain he would
come to no good; plain that he would die the death of
a sinner. When one day his body was found mortally
mangled by a tiger, not one of the Vandervermins was
shocked or surprised. No: they had always said that
something dreadful would happen to him, and it had come
about. Jacob was buried—handsomely buried. Not one
of the Vandervermins would have given him when alive
the value of a coffin nail; but, being dead, the case was
altered. The pride of the family was concerned in the
funeral; hence, they respected themselves in their treatment
of the deceased. Doubtless the ghost of a despised,
ill-used relation is propitiated by a costly burial;
and thus many a cousin or half-brother who has glided
through life in a cobweb coat has superfine cloth upon
his coffin.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had this history of Jacob Vandervermin from a Chinaman.
He repeated it to me with the eloquence and fervour
of a believer. The Chinamen—at least the sort that live
at Singapore—believe that when the tiger kills its first man,
his ghost becomes its very slave; bound, ordered by fate to
be a sort of jackal to the tiger; compelled by destiny to
find the beast its dinners, even among his kith and kin.
Hence, a tiger having carried off one of a family, not one of
the survivors is from that moment safe. My Chinaman—he
passed for a very learned fellow among his tribe—had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>the most intimate knowledge of the Vandervermin tragedy,
which, after his own lofty fashion—painting his story as
though he was painting his native porcelain—he related to
me. I shall give it you in plain, cold English; for, my
good friends all, be it known to you, I scorn the flourish of
a traveller.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the age of eighteen Jacob Vandervermin—having
been knocked from uncle to uncle, the poor, passive family
shuttlecock—fell at length into the counting-house of his
richest, and oldest uncle, Peter. For two years did Jacob
eat the bread of dependence; for with that bitter word
was his bread always buttered—when he awakened the
inextinguishable ire of his rich and orderly relative. Jacob
had been guilty of a gross wickedness; in fact, of a crime,
in the eyes of Peter Vandervermin, of the deepest dye.
He had, in a moment of culpable neglect, let fall a large,
unsightly blot of ink upon his uncle’s ledger. To the mind
of Peter Vandervermin, his graceless nephew had thrown
an indelible stain upon the white reputation of the family;
at least Peter so avenged the fault, for without a word he
seized a ruler that lay upon the desk, and with it smote the
skull of the blotting offender. Jacob uttered no syllable;
but instantly closing the ledger, and raising it with both his
hands, he brought down the book of figures with such
precise vehemence upon the head of his uncle, that the
principal of the house of Vandervermin &amp; Co. lay stunned
and prostrate on the floor of his own temple—that is, of
his own counting-house.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now Jacob was not a man to give unnecessary trouble.
He knew that if he remained it would only cause his uncle
the pain and the perplexity of thrusting him from the house,
and therefore, with scarcely a penny in his purse, did Jacob
don his hat and cross his uncle’s threshold.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vain was it for him to beg the aid of any of the name of
Vandervermin. What, he—a poor creature, too, a pauper,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>a beggar, a—no, there was no worse word for him—he smite
so good, so tender an uncle! No, he might starve, perish;
it would be to share his wickedness to relieve him. It was
a secret comfort to the Vandervermins that Jacob, in a
momentary forgetfulness, had knocked down his uncle. That
sacrilegious blow had for ever and for ever snapped the
thousand fine ties that—despite of his previous errors—still
held him to the family heart. Now he might perish; and
the sooner the better. The only hope was that he would
be drowned, or decently starved to death; that, for the
sake of the family, he would not come to be hanged, however
richly he deserved it.</p>

<p class='c010'>For some weeks Jacob continued to live without money.
Nothing, perhaps, so eminently shows the superiority, the
crowning greatness of the human animal—a fact so well
attested in many cases—as the power of man to subsist for
a time without cash. He is a self-wonder while he does
it; nevertheless, the miracle is performed. Tear a plant
up by the roots—fling it aside—and it perishes. Shut a
cat up in an empty, mouseless garret, and one by one her
nine lives will go out. But take money from man—money,
which is the root of evil, a root upon which man best
flourishes, thereby proving the wickedness of his nature—and
still, still he lives. Perhaps, somehow, the
carnivorous, omnivorous animal becomes an air-plant, and
so feeds upon the atmosphere about him. I have met
with many air-plants of the sort. There is not a city,
a town, without them. Such men get over days, and
weeks, and months, and wonder how they have so successfully
travelled thus far to the grave. They must rub their
hands, that they have cheated what seemed to them a vital
principle of nature.</p>

<p class='c010'>And in this way Jacob Vandervermin lived. Every day
seemed to him a difficult stepping-stone to get over, and yet
the night saw him on the other side of it. But it is hard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>miserable work, this keeping check against time by meals in
the bowels: this incessant looking for butcher and baker
as the allies against death, and wondering and trembling
from day to day, lest they should not come to the
rescue. My friends, this is hard, debasing work—I have
known it.</p>

<p class='c010'>One day, with thoughts heavy as lead upon his brain, did
Jacob Vandervermin wander forth. He wandered and
wandered, until, weary and spent, he sank upon the stump
of a tree in a desolate place. “How—how,” cried Jacob,
“shall I live another day!”</p>

<p class='c010'>What a mole-eyed thing is man! How he crucifies himself
with vain thoughts—how he stands upon tiptoe, straining
his eyestrings, trying to look into the future, when at that
moment the play is over—the show is done.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jacob had scarcely uttered—“How shall I live another
day!” when a tiger, a royal tiger—wherefore a cruel,
treacherous, bloodthirsty beast should be called royal, I
know not—when a royal tiger—fell like a thunderbolt upon
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>As a very large tom-cat snaps in its mouth a very small
mouse, and looking statelily around seems to say—the mouse
kicking all the while—“Pooh, pooh; why this is nothing!”
so did the royal tiger look and speak, with Jacob
Vandervermin writhing and screaming in its jaw. Well,
tigers make short work of men. Almost as short as man
himself sometimes makes of his fellow biped. Jacob
Vandervermin—it was his luck to meet with a benevolent
tiger; he was not played with before he was finally crunched—Jacob
Vandervermin was soon dead.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now, my friends, prepare for a wonder! Long
before the tiger had picked the bones of Jacob—Jacob’s
ghost stood, like a waiting footman, meekly behind the
dining animal. There was Jacob in his wide, parasol-like
hat of straw—his white jacket and trousers, in all things the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>same as when he lived, save that he was so transparent the
eye could see through him: and then his look was so serene
and passionless! It was odd to see how meekly the ghost
looked on the while the tiger gnawed and crunched, and
then with its rasping tongue cleaned the bones of the ghost’s
late body. It was plain that the ghost cared no more for
what he once thought the most valuable thing under
heaven, than if it were an old threadbare coat, put aside for
a glorious garment. Thus, after a few minutes, the ghost
seated itself upon the stump of the tree—where, a short
time before, it had sat in the flesh—and twiddling its thumbs,
looked composedly about it. And when the tiger had
finished Jacob—for the poor animal had not for a week
before tasted so much as a field mouse—it stalked away to
its den, the ghost of Jacob following it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gorged to the whiskers, almost for two whole days
did the tiger sleep. And then rising and stretching
itself—like a Mogul after a debauch—the tiger said,
“Jacob!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What wills my lord?” answered Jacob’s ghost.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Jacob, I must sup: something nice, now—something
delicate. I don’t like to say it to your face, Jacob, but
you haven’t quite agreed with me. I could fancy something
mild and tender to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>For a moment the ghost was thoughtful; then observed,
“What says my lord to a nice sugar-cane salad?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The tiger leered somewhat pityingly at the ghost; then
saying “Look here!” opened its jaws. Even the ghost of
Jacob shivered—like moonlight upon water—at the dreadful
array of teeth. “Think you,” said the tiger, “such teeth
were made for salads?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tigers, I have heard, were not always flesh-eaters,” said
the ghost, a little boldly.</p>
<div id='i135'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i135.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“Almost for two whole days did the tiger sleep”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c009'>“Why, there is a story among tigers,” answered the ingenuous
brute, “that at one time—but it’s a long time ago—we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>used to crop clover and trefoil and wild thyme, for all
the world like foolish little lambs. And then suddenly—but
how it came about I never heard—we took to eating
the kids and lambkins that before we played with. How
the change began, and who took to killing first, I know
not: I have only heard it wasn’t tigers; and now, I only
know that I must sup: that this very night I must have
another Vandervermin. Have you any babies in the
house?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“None: I assure you, my lord, not one,” answered the
ghost.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s a pity,” said the tiger, “for I feel it, my stomach
needs something tender and succulent. However, lead on:
air and exercise may tone my vitals a little. Why do you
tarry, sirrah?”—and the tiger growled like a stage tyrant—“you
know your destiny; lead on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The ghost seemed to feel the truthful force of the
rebuke, and immediately led the way. As they walked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>on, the ghost espied a remarkably fine ox, strayed from
a neighbouring farm. “See, my lord, see!” cried the
shadow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no,” said the tiger, a little contemptuously. “I
can’t do that sort of thing now: having once tasted the
goodness of man, I must go on with him. No, no; I thank
my luck I now know what good living really is.” And then
the tiger paused, and twisting its tail gracefully about its
legs, as sometimes an ingenuous maid will twist about a
gown flounce, the brute observed—“What a lovely night!
How the air freshens one’s spirits! What a beautiful
moon—and how the stars shine—and the airs whisper
among the tamarind trees, like unseen fairies making
love! You are sure, Jacob, there is not a baby in the
house?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing like it, my lord,” answered Jacob.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is the best you can promise me?” asked the
tiger.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-night, I’m afraid nothing better than Drusilla, my
aunt,” said the ghost. The tiger growled dubiously; and
then said, “Well, we can but look at her. You know the
safest way—so mind what you’re about.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Cautiously, stealthily, goaded by fate, did the ghost of
Jacob lead the tiger to the mansion of Peter Vandervermin.
Leaping a low wall, they gained a garden, and proceeded
along a winding walk, until they came to a pretty little
summer pavilion, wherein sat aunt Drusilla, as was her
wont, knitting, with a large Dutch pug at her feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s your supper,” said Jacob, pointing to the
withered old gentlewoman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Humph!” growled the tiger, and angrily twitched its
tail—“humph! It’s against my stomach; I can’t do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What think you,” urged the ghost, “of the pug just
for a snack?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The tiger curled its whiskers with a look of disgust, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>growling “dropsical,” turned supperless away. And all the
next night did the tiger fast. But sweet is the sauce of
hunger; for on the third evening the tiger rose and
stretched itself, and its eyes glared with brightening flame
as it said—“Come along, Jacob: I don’t know that the
old woman will eat badly after all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jacob again conducted the destroyer to the house.
Again showed Drusilla, unconscious of her fate, knitting,
knitting. There was a slight growl—a spring—an old
woman’s scream—a yap, yap from the pug—and then
the wall was leapt—and Peter Vandervermin was a
widower.</p>

<p class='c010'>I will not follow the tiger to its banquet. Suffice it to
say, the tiger ate and slept. However, very ill and feverish
did the tiger awake in the morning. “Jacob,” cried the
tiger, “what’s the matter with me? Phew! I can hardly
move.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps,” said Jacob, “my lord has just a stitch in his
side.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no,” said the tiger, “I feel ’em now; it’s that
abominable old woman’s knitting needles.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Every rose has its thorn, my lord,” said the ghost,
joking as a ghost may be supposed to joke. “You never
find a woman without pins and needles.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Jacob,” cried the tiger, “either you come of a very bad
family, or, after all, man-eating is by no means so wholesome—however
pleasant it may be—as a hearty, simple
meal off a buffalo, a deer, or anything of that sort.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then why, my lord,” urged the ghost, “why not
return to the humbler diet?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s all very well, Jacob. Why don’t men—with red
noses and no insides—turn from arrack and new rum, and
drink only at the diamond spring? I begin to feel myself
no better than a drunkard: yes, I fear I’m a lost tiger. It’s
very nice—very delicious to eat a man at night—but it’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>like what I’ve heard of drink—what a headache it leaves in
the morning! Ha!” cried the beast, “I’m afraid I’m
making quite a man of myself. Look at my tongue,
Jacob; it’s as hard and as dry, you might grind an
axe upon it. Oh, that dreadful old woman!”—and
the tiger closed its heavy, bloodshot eyes, and tried to
sleep.</p>

<p class='c010'>Only three days past, and then the tiger leapt up, and
licking itself all over—as though it was going out to an
evening party, and wished to put the very best gloss upon
its coat—the creature cried—“Come away, Jacob; I must
have another Vandervermin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, my lord,” cried the ghost, “think what you’ll
suffer in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>That</i> for the morning,” cried the tiger, whisking its
tail—“I tell you, Jacob, I intend to make a night of it.
Slave, lead on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And thus for three months, conducted by the fate-enforced
ghost, did the tiger continue to sup off Vandervermins.
Uncles and aunts, cousins male and female, in
all eight, had the tiger devoured, when one night the brute
carried off the ninth and last victim in the person of Justus
Vandervermin, lawyer and usurer. The tiger—strange to
say—devoured every bit of him; but it was the brute’s last
morsel; it never could digest him. Justus Vandervermin

tiger. Nothing could stir the lawyer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Jacob,” cried the brute, feeling its last hour approach.
“I shall die, and your ghost will be at rest. I forgive
you—but why—why didn’t you tell me that Justus was a
lawyer?”</p>

<p class='c010'>And with these words the tiger died, and the ghost of
Jacob Vandervermin was instantly at peace.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, true or not, this much,” answered Captain Bam;

  <h2 class='c006'>A GOSSIP AT RECULVERS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>The</span> spirit of the Saxon seems still to linger along the
shores of Kent. There is the air of antiquity about
them; a something breathing of the olden day—an
influence, surviving all the changes of time, all the
vicissitudes of politic and social life. The genius of
the Heptarchy comes closer upon us from the realm
of shadows; the Wittenagemote is not a convocation
of ghosts—not a venerable House of Mists; but a living,
talking, voting Parliament. We feel a something old,
strong, stubborn, hearty; a something for the intense
meaning of which we have no other word than “English”
rising about us from every rood of Kent. And wherefore
this? England was not made piecemeal. Her
foundations in the deep—could a sea of molten gold
purchase the worth of her surrounding ocean?—are of
the same age. The same sun has risen and set upon
the whole island. Wherefore, then, is Kent predominant
in the mind for qualities which the mind denies to other
counties? Because it is still invested with the poetry
of action. Because we feel that Kent was the cradle
of the marrow and bone of England; because we still see,
ay, as palpably as we behold yonder trail of ebon smoke—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>broad black pennant of that mighty admiral, Steam—the
sails of Cæsar threatening Kent, and Kent barbarians
clustering on the shore, defying him. It is thus
that the spirit of past deeds survives immortally, and
works upon the future: it is thus we are indissolubly
linked to the memories of the bygone day by the still
active soul that once informed it.</p>
<p class='c010'>How rich in thoughts—how fertile in fancies that
quicken the brain and dally with the heart, is every footpace
of the soil! Reader, be with us for a brief time at
this beautiful village of Herne. The sky is sullen; and
summer, like a fine yet froward wench, smiles now and
then, now frowns the blacker for the passing brightness:
nevertheless, summer in her worst mood cannot spoil the
beautiful features of this demure, this antique village.
It seems a very nest—warm and snug, and green—for
human life; with the twilight haze of time about it,
almost consecrating it from the aching hopes and feverish
expectations of the present. Who would think that the
bray and roar of multitudinous London sounded but some
sixty miles away? The church stands peacefully, reverently,
like some old visionary monk, his feet on earth—his
thoughts with God. And the graves are all about;
and things of peace and gentleness, like folded sheep, are
gathered round it.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is a stile which man might make the throne of
solemn thought—his pregnant matter, the peasant bones
that lie beneath. And on the other side, a park, teeming
with beauty; with sward green as emeralds, and soft as
a mole’s back; and trees, with centuries circulating in their
gnarled massiveness.</p>

<p class='c010'>But we must quit the churchyard, and turning to the
right, we will stroll towards Reculvers. How rich the
swelling meadows! How their green breasts heave with
conceived fertility! And on this side corn-fields; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>grain stalk thick as a reed; the crop level and compact
as a green bank. And here, too, is a field of canary seed:
of seed grown for London birds in London cages. The
farmer shoots the sparrow—the little rustic scoundrel—that
with felonious bill would carry away one grain sown for,
made sacred to, Portman Square canary! We might,
perhaps, find a higher parallel to this did we look with
curious eyes about us. Nevertheless, bumpkin sparrow has
his world of air to range in; his free loves; and for his
nest his ivied wall or hawthorn bush. These, say the
worst, are a happy set-off even against a gilt-wired cage;
sand like diamond dust; unfailing seed, and sugar from even
the sweeter lips of lady mistress. Powder and small shot
may come upon the sparrow like apoplexy upon an alderman,
with the unbolted morsel in its gullet; yet, consider—hath
the canary no danger to encounter? Doth not prosperity
keep a cat?</p>

<p class='c010'>Well, this idle gossip has brought us within a short
distance of Reculvers. Here—so goes the hoary legend—Augustine
impressed the first Christian foot upon the English
shore, sent hither by good Pope Gregory; no less good that,
if the same legend be true, he had a subtle sense of a joke.
Christianity, unless historians say what is not, owes somewhat
of its introduction into heathen England to a pun.
The story is so old that there is not a schoolmaster’s dog
throughout merry Britain that could not bark it. Nevertheless,
we will indicate our moral courage by repeating it. Our
ink turns red with blushes at the thought—no matter—for
once we will write in our blushes.</p>
<div id='i143'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i143.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“Sugar from even the sweeter lips of lady mistress”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c009'>Pope Gregory, seeing some white-haired, pink-cheeked
boys for sale in the Roman slave-market, asked who they
were? <i>Sunt Angli</i>—they are English, was the response.
<i>Non sunt Angli</i>—<i>sed Angeli</i>; they are not English, but
angels, was the Papal playfulness. His Holiness then
inquired from what part of England. <i>Deirii</i>, they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Deirians, was the answer. Whereupon the pope, following
up his vein of pleasantry, said, <i>Non Deirii, sed De ira</i>—not
Deirians, but from the anger of the Lord: snatched, as his
Holiness indicated, from the vengeance that must always
light upon heathenism.</p>

<p class='c010'>This grey-haired story, like the grey hairs of Nestor, is
pregnant with practical wisdom. Let us imagine Pope
Gregory to have been a dull man; even for a pope a dull
man. Let us allow that his mind had not been sufficiently
comprehensive to take within its circle the scattered lights
of intelligence, which, brought into a focus, make a joke.
Suppose, in a word, that the pope had had no ear for a
pun? Saint Augustine might still have watched the bubbles
upon Tiber, and never have been sea-sick on his English
voyage.</p>

<p class='c010'>What does this prove? What does this incident preach
with a thunder-tongue? Why, the necessity, the vital
necessity, of advancing no man to any sort of dignity, who
is not all alive as an eel to a joke. We are convinced of
it. The world will never be properly ruled, until jests
entirely supersede the authority of Acts of Parliament.
As it is, the Acts are too frequently the jests, without the
fun.</p>

<p class='c010'>We are now close to Reculvers. There, reader, there—where
you see that wave leaping up to kiss that big white
stone—that is the very spot where Saint Augustine put
down the sole of his Catholic foot. If it be not, we have
been misinformed and cheated of our money; we can say
no more.</p>

<p class='c010'>Never mind the spot. Is there not a glory lighting up
the whole beach? Is not every wave of silver—every
little stone, a shining crystal? Doth not the air vibrate
with harmonies, strangely winding into the heart, and
awakening the brain! Are we not under the spell of the
imagination which makes the present vulgarity melt away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>like morning mists, and shows to us the full, uplighted glory
of the past?</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a landing on the Sussex Coast; a landing of
a Duke of Normandy, and a horde of armed cut-throats.
Looking at them even through the distance of some eight
hundred years, what are they but as a gang of burglars?
A band of pick-purses—blood-shedders—robbers!</p>

<p class='c010'>What was this landing of a host of men, in the full
trump and blazonry of war—what all their ships, their
minstrelsey, and armed power—to the advent of Augustine
and his fellow-monks, brought hither by the forlornness of
the soul of man? it is this thought that makes this bit of
pebbled beach a sacred spot; it is this spirit of meditation
that hears in every little wave a sweet and solemn music.</p>

<p class='c010'>And there, where the ocean tumbles, was in the olden
day a goodly town, sapped, swallowed by the wearing, the
voracious sea. At lowest tides the people still discover
odd, quaint, household relics, which, despite the homely
breeding of the finders, must carry away their thoughts into
the mist of time, and make them feel antiquity. The
very children of the village are hucksters of the spoils of
dead centuries. They grow up with some small trading
knowledge of fossils; and are deep, very deep in all sorts
of petrifactions. They must have strange early sympathies
towards that mysterious town with all its tradesfolk and
market-folk sunk below the sea; a place of which they
have a constant inkling in the petty spoils lashed upwards
by the tempest. Indeed, it is difficult for the mind to
conceive the annihilation of a whole town, engulfed in the
ocean. The tricksy fancy will assert itself; and looking
over the shining water, with summer basking on it, we are
apt to dream that the said market-town has only suffered a
“sea-change”; and that fathoms deep, the town still stands—that
busy life goes on—that people of an odd, sea-green
aspect, it may be, still carry on the work of mortal breathing;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>make love, beget little ones, and die. But this, indeed,
is the dream of idleness. Yet, who—if he could change
his mind at will, would make his mind incapable of such
poor fantasies? How much of the coarse web of existence
owes its beauty to the idlest dreams with which we colour it!</p>

<p class='c010'>The village of Reculvers is a choice work of antiquity.
The spirit of King Ethelbert tarries there still, and lives
enshrined in the sign of a public-house. It would be well
for all kings could their spirits survive with such genial
associations. There are some dead royalties too profitless
even for a public sign. Who, now, with any other choice
would empty a tankard under the auspices of Bloody Mary,
as that anointed “femininitie” is called; or take a chop
even at Nero’s Head? No; inn-keepers know the subtle
prejudices of man, nor violate the sympathies of life with
their sign-posts.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here, on the sanded floor of King Ethelbert’s hostelry,
do village antiquarians often congregate. Here, at times,
are stories told—stories not all unworthy of the type of
Antiquarian <i>Transactions</i>—of <i>fibulæ</i>, talked of as buckles, and
other tangible bits of Roman history. Here, we have
heard, how a certain woman—living at this blessed hour,
and the mother of a family—went out at very low tide, and
found the branch of a filbert-tree with clustering filberts on
it, all stone, at least a thousand years old—and more.
Here, too, have we heard of a wonderful horse-shoe, picked
up by Joe Squellins; a shoe, as the finder averred, as old
as the world. Poor Joe! What was his reward?—it may
be, a pint of ale for that inestimable bit of iron! And yet
was he a working antiquarian. Joe Squellins had within
him the unchristened elements of F.S.A.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sea has spared something of the old churchyard;
although it has torn open the sad sanctity of the grave, and
reveals to the day, corpse upon corpse—layers of the dead,
thickly, closely packed, body upon body. A lateral view
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>of rows of skeletons, entombed in Christian earth centuries
since, for a moment staggers the mind, with this inward
peep of the grave. We at once see the close, dark prison
of the churchyard, and our breath comes heavily, and we
shudder. It is only for a moment. There is a lark
singing, singing over our head—a mile upwards in the
blue heaven—singing like a freed soul: we look again, and
smile serenely at the bones of what was man.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many of our gentle countrymen—fellow-metropolitans—who
once a year wriggle out their souls from the slit of
their tills to give the immortal essence sea air, make a
pilgrimage to Reculvers. This Golgotha, we have noted
it, has to them especial attractions. Many are the mortal
relics borne away to decorate a London chimney-piece.
Many a skeleton gives up its rib, its <i>ulna</i>, two or three odd
<i>vertebræ</i>, or some such gimcrack to the London visitor, for
a London ornament. Present the same man with a bone
from a London hospital, and he would hold the act
abominable, irreligiously presumptuous. But time has
“silvered o’er” the bone from Reculvers; has cleansed it
from the taint of mortality; has merged the loathsomeness
in the curiosity; for time turns even the worst of horrors
to the broadest of jests. We have now Guy Fawkes
about to blow Lords and Commons into eternity—and now
Guy Fawkes masked for a pantomime.</p>

<p class='c010'>One day, wandering near this open graveyard, we met a
boy, carrying away, with exulting looks, a skull in very
perfect preservation. He was a London boy, and looked
rich indeed with his treasure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What have you there?” we asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A man’s head—a skull,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And what can you possibly do with a skull?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take it to London.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And when you have it in London, what then will you
do with it?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“I know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No doubt. But what will you do with it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>And to this thrice-repeated question the boy three times
answered, “I know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, here’s sixpence. Now, what will you do with
it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy took the coin—grinned—hugged himself,
hugging the skull the closer, and said very briskly, “Make
a money box of it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>A strange thought for a child. And yet, mused we as
we strolled along, how many of us, with nature beneficent and
smiling on all sides—how many of us think of nothing so
much as hoarding sixpences—yea, hoarding them even in
the very jaws of desolate Death!</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>THE TWO WINDOWS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>The</span> Union Workhouse of the ancient parish of Herne—how
calm and pastoral is that little nook of Kent!—has
two outward windows. The fabric, built by the inspiration
of the New Poor-law, was a blind, eyeless piece of
brickwork; a gaol for the iniquity and perseverance of
poverty; a Newgate for the felony of want. The chiefs
and elders of Parliament had said, “Let us make abiding-places
for the poor; let us separate them, lepers as they
are, from the clean; let us shut them up from the sight
of the green earth; let them not behold the work of the
season in the budding trees, in their leafy branches, in their
red and golden robes of autumn, in the gaunt bareness of
solemn winter. Let the grass spring and the wild-flower
blossom; but let not the poor, the unclean of the land,
look upon the work of God.” After this resolve the
Union was built; with inner windows looking upon walls,
and walls turned blank upon the outward world. No
crevice, no loophole permitted captive poverty a look, a
glimpse of the fresh face of nature; his soul, like his body,
was bricked up according to statute; he had by the insolence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>of destitution offended the niceness of the world, and
he was doomed by his judges to a divorce from the
commonest rights of earth. Hence, the Union Workhouse
turned its sullen, unbroken wall of brick upon the fields and
trees, and the pauper was made to look only upon pauperism.
The freshness and luxuriance of nature—her prodigal loveliness—was
not for his eyes; he was poor, and even to
behold the plenteousness of the teeming earth was an enjoyment
beyond his state—a banned delight—a luxury
which those who paid for his food could not properly
vouchsafe him!</p>
<p class='c010'>At length—when they themselves know it not, men’s
hearts will work, a sense of right will sometimes steal
upon their sleep, an instinct of goodness will, like silver
water from the rock, gush forth—at length it was resolved
by the guardians of the poor—guardians of the poor! what
a holiness of purpose should inform those well-worn syllables—that
the dull, blind, squalid workhouse should have light;
that its brick walls should be pierced with two windows;
that the fields and trees should gladden pauper eyes, appealing
to old recollections; childhood thoughts; daily,
customary feelings. It was determined that the pauper
prisoner should, through the iron bars of penury, have
comforting glimpses of God’s goodness without; that he
should, though all unconsciously, make offerings upon the
green altar of the earth; that his heart should commune,
in its own unknowing way, with those sweet influences,
which, coming from God, discourse in some manner to
all men.</p>

<p class='c010'>And so it was determined that the Union Workhouse
should have two outward windows. The guardians of the
poor appeared with the labourers. “Here,” said the
guardians, “break through the wall; here pierce one
window—here, another.” Then turning to the paupers,
some few age-stricken folks, they said, with smug complacency,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“We are going to give you some light.” And
this, reader, is not a goosequill fiction; it is a thing of
truth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are going to give you some light.” We cannot
help it, if this liberal goodness—this gentle philanthropy—drive
back thought to the first gift of light; if it call up,
as with an iron tongue, the memory of the holy birth of
light, word-begotten, of all men. And the nature of man,
solemnised by such memories—kindled and uplifted, skies
beyond expression, by the sublime inheritance—is it not a
hard task to consider with composure even the compunction
of a guardian of the poor, who pierces with two windows
the prison-house of the pauper to let God’s light in?
May not the small authority of man be sometimes as a
blaspheming burlesque of Almighty Beneficence?</p>

<p class='c010'>Let us, for a time forgetful of state philosophy—forgetful
of the plausibilities of social prosperity that set the poor
apart from the rich and well-to-do, as creatures somewhat
different in the real drama of life, although on certain
occasions, as it were for form’s sake, for Christian ceremony,
allowed to be made from the clay of the same Eden
as their masters—let us behold the earth in its freshness,
and man, its owner, in the vigour of his new birth, the
heir of an impartial Providence, and the receiver of its
glories; and then consider him as the task-master of his
fellow, as the grudging churl that metes out light and air
to his helpless brother; and for this sole cause—this one
bitter reason—he <i>is</i> helpless.</p>

<p class='c010'>A miserable sight—a hideous testimony of the thankfulness
of prosperous man—is the rural union, with its blank
dead wall of brick; a cold, blind thing, the work of human
perversity and human selfishness, amidst ten thousand thousand
evidences of Eternal bounty. How beautiful is the
beauty of God around it! There is not a sapling waving
its green tresses of June that does not make the heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>yearn with kindliness; not a field-flower that does not,
with its speaking eye, tell of abundant goodness; the
brook is musical with the same sweet truth; all sights and
sounds declare it. The liberal loveliness of nature, turn
where we will, looks upon and whispers to us. We are
made the heirs of wealth inexhaustible, of pleasures deep as
the sea and pure as the joys of Paradise. And our return
for this, our offering to the wretchedness of our fellow-creatures,
is yonder prison, with its dead wall turned upon
the pleasant aspects of nature, lest the pauper captives
within should behold what God has done for that world,
in which, according to the world’s justice, they have
nothing. Hence is the pauper treated, in his blind
dungeon, as though there was a felonious purpose in his
eyesight; as though, a prisoner in the union, he would
commit larceny on the meads and trees, and all the rural
objects that from babyhood have been familiar to him, to
the exceeding injury and loss of the free folks, who, by the
blessing of skill and good luck, have “land and beeves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We know not a more fantastic tyranny, a more wilful
assertion of the arrogance of man, than this needless shutting
up of his poorer brother in a gaol of poverty—barring
his eyes of every comforting object, compelling him to
look only upon that which at every look speaks to his soul
of his miserable dependence upon his richer fellow; which
denies to him the innocent, unbought glimpse of out-door
nature, as though the scene was a land of promise from
which his beggary had made him alien. Is human want
so wicked that it should be unblessed with even a glance
at the pleasant things of creation? Has the pauper—because
pauper—no further claim upon the earth, save for his
final bed—the grave? The rustic unions, with their forlorn
blank walls, cry, yes!</p>

<p class='c010'>If God punish man for crime, as man punishes man for
poverty, woe to the sons of Adam!</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>THE ORDER OF POVERTY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Why</span> should not Lazarus make to himself an order of
tatters? Why should not poverty have its patch of honour?
Wherefore should not the undubbed knights of evil fortune
carry about them, with a gracious humility, the inevitable
types of their valorous contest with the Paynim iniquities
of life? Wherefore may not man wear indigence as proudly
as nobility flashes its jewels? Is there not a higher heraldry
than that of the college?</p>
<p class='c010'>Not a very long time ago the King of Greece awarded
to an Englishman the Order of the Redeemer. The
Englishman did not reject the gift; he did not stare
with wonder, or smile in meek pity at the grave mockery
of the distinction; but winning the consent of our Sovereign
Lady Victoria to sport the jewel, the Knight of Christ—knight
by the handiwork of the King of Greece—hung
about him the Order of the Redeemer.</p>

<p class='c010'>And what may be the gracious discipline of this Order
of Redemption? Has the new knight sold off all that
he had, and given the money to the poor? We have
heard of no such broker’s work; and surely the newspaper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>tongue would have given loud utterance to the penitence
of Mammon. What discipline, then, does this Order of
Christ compel upon its holy and immaculate brotherhood?
What glorifying services towards the heart and spirit of
man what self-martyrdom does it recompense? Is it
the bright reward of humility—of active loving-kindness
towards everything that breathes? Is it that the knighted,
beyond ten thousand men, has proved the divine temper of
the spiritual follower of Jesus, making his hourly life an
active goodness, and with every breath drawn drawing
nearer to rewarding Heaven? Surely the Order of the
Redeemer—that awful, solemn badge, setting apart its
wearer from the sordid crowd of earth—could only be
vouchsafed to some hard Christian service—could only
reward some triumphant wrestling of the suffering soul—some
wondrous victory in the forlorn hope of this dark
struggling life. These are our thoughts—these our passionate
words; whereupon the herald of the court of Greece—a
grave, fantastic wizard—with mildly-reproving look
and most delicate speech, says: “You are wrong: quite
wrong. The Order of the Redeemer, though by no
means the first Order, is a very pretty Order in its way.
Six months since we gave it to Captain Jonquil, from
Paris; and truly no man more deserved the Order of the
Redeemer. He taught His Majesty’s infantry the use
of the bayonet: his howitzer practice, too, is a divine
thing. Captain Jonquil is a great soldier. Last week
the Order of the Redeemer was also bestowed upon
Andreas, a great favourite at court—but, if the naughty
truth must be told, a pimp.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alas! is heraldry always innocent of blasphemy?</p>

<p class='c010'>On the 13th of June 1843, a grave masque—a solemn
ceremony—was held at the court of St James. Heraldry
again looked smug and pompous. A knight was to be
made of “the most ancient Order of the Thistle.” Let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>us make a clean breast of our ignorance; we assert nothing
against the antiquity of the Thistle; for what we know,
it may be as old—ay, as old as asses. But upon the glad
13th of June a chapter was held, and John, Marquis of
Bute, and the Right Hon. William, Earl of Mansfield,
were elected knights. They of course took the oaths to
protect and succour distressed maidens, orphans and widows;
to abstain from every sort of wrong, and to do every sort
of right.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Marquis of Bute then kneeling near the Sovereign,
and Mr Woods on his knee, presenting to the Queen the
riband and jewel of the Order, Her Majesty was graciously
pleased to place the same over the noble Marquis’s left
shoulder. His Lordship rising, kissed the Sovereign’s
hand, and having received the congratulations of the
knights brethren, retired.”</p>

<p class='c010'>From that moment John, Marquis of Bute, looked and
moved with the aspect and bearing of a man, radiant with
new honours. He was a Knight of the Thistle, and the
jewel sparkling at his bosom feebly typified the bright,
admiring looks of the world—the gaze of mingled love
and admiration bent upon him. But on this earth—in
this abiding-place of equity—men do not get even thistles
for nothing. It may, indeed, happen that desert may
pant and moan without honour; but in the court of kings,
where justice weighs with nicest balance, honour never
with its smiles mocks imbecility, or gilds with outward
lustre a concealed rottenness. Honour never gives alms,
but awards justice. Mendicancy, though with liveried
lackies clustering at its carriage—and there is such
pauperism—may whine and pray its hardest, yet move
not the inflexible herald. He awards those jewels to
virtue, which virtue has sweated, bled for. And it is
with this belief, yea, in the very bigotry of the creed,
we ask—what has John, Marquis of Bute, fulfilled to earn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>his thistle? What, the Right Hon. William, Earl of
Mansfield? What dragon wrong has either overcome?
What giant Untruth stormed in Sophist Castle? What
necromantic wickedness baffled and confounded? Yet,
these battles have been fought—these triumphs won; oh!
who shall doubt them? Be sure of it, ye unbelieving
demagogues—scoffing plebians, not for nothing nobility
browses upon thistles.</p>

<p class='c010'>We pay all honour to these inventions, these learned
devices of the Herald. They doubtless clothe, comfort,
and adorn humanity, which, without them, would be cold,
naked, shrunk, and squalid. They, moreover, gloriously
attest the supremacy of the tame, the civilised man, over
the wild animal. The orders of the Herald are <i>tattoo</i>
without the pain of puncture. The New Zealander
carries his knighthood, lined and starred and flowered,
in his visage. The civilised knight hangs it more conveniently
on a riband.</p>

<p class='c010'>We are such devout believers in the efficacy of Orders,
that we devote this small essay to an attempt to make
them, under some phase or other, universal. We will
not linger in a consideration of the Orders already dead;
lovely was their life, and as fragrant is their memory.
There was one Order—Teutonic, if we mistake not, the
Order of Fools. There was a quaint sincerity in the
very title of this brotherhood. Its philosophy was out-speaking;
and more than all, the constitution of such a
chapter admitted knights against whose worthiness, whose
peculiar right to wear the badge, no envious demagogue
could say his bitter saying. Surely, in our reverence for
the wisdom of antiquity, this Order might have resurrection.
The Fool might have his bauble newly varnished—his cap
newly hung with tinkling bells. Some of us chirp and
cackle of the wisdom of the bygone day; but that is only
wisdom which jumps with our own cunning; which fortifies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>us in the warm and quiet nook of some hallowed prejudice.
From the mere abstract love of justice, we should be right
glad to have the Order of Fools revived in the fullest
splendour of Folly. Such an Order would so beneficently
provide for many unrewarded public idlers—ay, and public
workers.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a time when the world in its first childhood
needed playthings. Then was the Herald the world’s toy-maker,
and made for it pretty little nick-knacks—golden
fleeces—stars, ribands and garters; tempting the world
to follow the kickshaws, as nurse with sugared bread-and-butter
tempts the yeanling to try its tottering feet. The
world has grown old—old and wise: yet is not the Herald
bankrupt, but like a pedlar at a fair, draws the hearts of
simple men after the shining, silken glories in his box.
Meanwhile, philosophy in hodden grey, laughs at the
crowd, who bellow back the laugh and sometimes pelt
the reverend fool for his irreligious humour: for he who
believes not in Stars and Garters is unbeliever; to the
world’s best and brightest faith, atheist and scoffer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Is it not strange that a man should think the better of
himself for a few stones glittering in his bosom? That a
costly band about the leg should make the blood dance
more swiftly through the arteries? That a man seeing his
breast set with jewellers’ stars should think them glorious
as the stars of heaven—himself, little less than an earthly
god, so deified? If these things be really types and
emblems of true greatness, what rascal poverty besets the
man without them! How is he damned in his baseness!
What mere offal of humanity, the biped without an Order!
And, therefore, let stars be multiplied; and let nobility—like
bees—suck honey from Thistles!</p>

<p class='c010'>We are, however, confirmed in our late failing faith.
We are bigoted to Orders. Men, like watches, must work
the better upon jewels. Man is, at the best, a puppet;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>and is only put into dignified motion when pulled by Blue
or Red Ribands. Now, as few, indeed, of us can get
stars, garters or ribands, let us have Orders of our own.
Let us, with invincible self-complacency, ennoble ourselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the hopeless ignorance and vulgarity of our first
prejudice, we might possibly want due veneration for the
Golden Fleece; an ancient and most noble Order, worn
by few. Yet with all our worst carelessness towards the
Order, we never felt for it the same pitying contempt we
feel towards an Order worn by many—not at their button-holes,
not outside their breasts, but in the very core of their
hearts—the Order of the Golden Calf.</p>

<p class='c010'>Oh! bowelless Plutus, what a host of Knights! What
a lean-faced, low-browed, thick-jowled, swag-bellied brotherhood!
Deformity, in all its fantastic variety, meets in the
chapter. They wear no armour of steel or brass, but are
cased in the magic mail of impenetrable Bank-paper. They
have no sword, no spear, no iron mace with spikes; but
they ride merrily into the fight of life, swinging about gold-gutted
purses, and levelling with the dust rebellious poverty.
These are the Knights of the Golden Calf. It is a glorious
community. What a look of easy triumph they have!
With what serene self-satisfaction they measure the wide
distance between mere paupers—the Knights of the Order
of Nothing—and themselves! How they walk the earth
as if they alone possessed the patent of walking upright!
How they dilate in the light of their own gold, like adders
in the sun!</p>

<p class='c010'>A most fatal honour is this Order of the Golden Calf.
It is worn unseen, as we have said, in the hearts of men;
but its effects are visible: the disease speaks out in every
atom of flesh—poor human worm’s-meat!—and throbs in
every muscle. It poisons the soul; gives the eye a squint;
takes from the face of fellow-man its God-gifted dignity,
and makes him a thing to prey upon; to work, to use up;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>to reduce to so much hard cash; then to be put up, with a
wary look of triumph, into the pocket. This Order damns
with a leprosy of soul its worshipper. It blinds and deafens
him to the glories and the harmonies ministrant to poorer
men. His eye is jaundiced, and in the very stars of God
he sees nought but twinkling guineas.</p>

<p class='c010'>At this moment great is the Order throughout the land!
Tyrannous its laws, reckless its doings. It is strong, and
why should it be just? To be of this Order is now the
one great striving of life. They alone are men who wear
the jewel—wretches they without it. Man was originally
made from the dust of the earth: he is now formed of a
richer substance: the true man is made of gold. Yes, the
regenerate Adam is struck only at the Mint.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Knights of the Order of the Golden Calf have no
formal ceremony of election; yet has brother knight almost
instinctive knowledge of brother. In the solitude of his
own thoughts is he made one of the community; in utter
privacy he kisses the pulseless hand of Plutus, and swears to
his supremacy. The oath divorces him from pauper-life—from
its cares, its wants, its sympathies. He is privileged
from the uneasiness of thought, the wear and tear of anxiety
for fellow-man; he is compact and self-concentrated in his
selfishness. Nought ruffles him that touches not that inmost
jewel of his soul, his knighthood’s Order.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the olden day the Knights of the Fleece, the Garter
and other glories, won their rank upon the battlefield—blood
and strife being to them the hand-maids of honour.
The chivalry of the Golden Calf is mild and gentle. It
splits no brain-pan, spills no blood; yet is it ever fighting.
We are at the exchange. Look at that easy, peaceful man.
What a serenity is upon his cheek! What a mild lustre
in his eye! How plainly is he habited! He wears the
livery of simplicity and the look of peace. Yet has he in
his heart the Order of the Golden Calf. He is one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Mammon’s boldest heroes. A very soldier of fortune.
He is now fighting—fighting valorously. He has come
armed with a bran-new lie—a falsehood of surpassing
temper, which with wondrous quietude he lays about him,
making huge gashes in the money-bags of those he fights
with. A good foreign lie, well finished and well mounted,
is to this Knight of the Golden Calf as the sword of Faery
to Orlando. With it he sometimes cuts down giant fortunes,
and after “grinds their bones to make his bread.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And there are small esquires and pages of the Order;
men who, with heart-felt veneration, lick their lips at the
Golden Calf, and with more than bridegroom yearning pant
for possession. These small folk swarm like summer-gnats;
and still they drone the praises of the Calf; and looking at
no other thing, have their eyes bleared and dazzled to all
beside.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Knights of the Golden Calf shed no blood; that is,
the wounds they deal bleed inwardly and give no evidence
of homicide. They are, too, great consumers of the marrow
of men; and yet they break no bones, but by a trick known
to their Order extract without fracture precious nutriment.
They are great alchemists, too; and turn the sweat of
unrequited poverty, aye, the tears of childhood, into drops
of gold.</p>

<p class='c010'>Much wrong, much violence, much wayward cruelty—if
the true history of knighthood were indicted—lies upon
the Fleece, the Garter, yes, upon the Templar’s Lamb;—yet
all is but as May-day pastime to the voracity, the ignorance,
the wilful selfishness, the bestial lowings of the Golden
Calf. And of this Order the oldest of the brotherhood
are the most gluttonous. There is one whose every fibre is
blasted with age. To the imagination his face is as a coffin-plate.
Yet is he all belly. As cruel as a cat though
toothless as a bird!</p>

<p class='c010'>Oh, ye knights, great and small—whether expanding on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the mart, or lying <i>perdu</i> in back parlours—fling from your
hearts the Order there, and feel for once the warmth of
kindly blood! The brotherhood chuckle at the adjuration.
Well, let us fight the Order with an Order.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Order of Poverty against the Order of the Golden
Calf!</p>

<p class='c010'>Will it not be a merry time, when men, with a blithe
face and open look, shall confess that they are poor? When
they shall be to the world what they are to themselves?
When the lie, the shuffle, the bland, yet anxious hypocrisy
of seeming, and seeming only, shall be a creed forsworn?
When Poverty asserts itself, and never blushes and stammers
at its true name, the Knights of the Calf must give ground.
Much of their strength, their poor renown, their miserable
glory, lies in the hypocrisy of those who would imitate
them. They believe themselves great, because the poor, in
the very ignorance of the dignity of poverty, would ape
their magnificence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Order of Poverty! How many sub-orders might
it embrace! As the spirit of Gothic chivalry has its
fraternities, so might the Order of Poverty have its
distinct devices.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Order of the Thistle! That is an order for
nobility—a glory to glorify marquisate or earldom. Can
we not, under the rule of Poverty, find as happy a badge?</p>

<p class='c010'>Look at this peasant. His face bronzed with midday
toil. From sunrise to sunset, with cheerful looks and
uncomplaining words, he turns the primal curse to dignity,
and manfully earns his bread in the sweat of his brow.
Look at the fields around! Golden with blessed corn.
Look at this bloodless soldier of the plough—this hero
of the sickle. His triumphs are there, piled up in bread-bestowing
sheaves. Is he not Sir Knight of the Wheat-Ear?
Surely, as truly dubbed in the heraldry of justice,
as any Knight of the Thistle.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>And here is a white-haired shepherd. As a boy, a
child, playful as the lambs he tended, he laboured. He
has dreamed away his life upon a hillside—on downs—on
solitary heaths. The humble, simple, patient watcher
for fellow-men. Solitude has been his companion: he has
grown old, wrinkled, bent in the eye of the burning sun.
His highest wisdom is a guess at the coming weather: he
may have heard of diamonds, but he knows the evening star.
He has never sat at a congress of kings: he has never
helped to commit a felony upon a whole nation. Yet is he
to our mind a most reverend Knight of the Fleece. If
the Herald object to this, let us call him Knight of the
Lamb! In its gentleness and patience, a fitting type of
the poor old shepherd.</p>

<p class='c010'>And here is a pauper, missioned from the workhouse to
break stones at the road-side. How he strikes and strikes
at that unyielding bit of flint! Is it not the stony heart
of the world’s injustice knocked at by poverty? What
haggardness is in his face! What a blight hangs about
him! There are more years in his looks than in his bones.
Time has marked him with an iron pen. He wailed as a
babe for bread his father was not allowed to earn. He
can recollect every dinner—they were so few—of his childhood.
He grew up, and want was with him even as his
shadow. He has shivered with cold—fainted with hunger.
His every day of life has been set about by goading
wretchedness. Around him, too, were the stores of plenty.
Food, raiment, and money mocked the man made half mad
with destitution. Yet, with a valorous heart, a proud conquest
of the shuddering spirit, he walked with honesty and
starved. His long journey of life hath been through thorny
places, and now he sits upon a pile of stones on the wayside,
breaking them for workhouse bread. Could loftiest
chivalry show greater heroism—nobler self-control, than
this old man, this weary breaker of flints? Shall he not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>be of the Order of Poverty? Is not penury to him even
as a robe of honour? His grey workhouse coat braver
than purple and miniver? He shall be Knight of the
Granite if you will. A workhouse gem, indeed—a
wretched, highway jewel—yet, to the eye of truth, finer
than many a ducal diamond.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>“He has dreamed his life upon a hillside—”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c009'>This man is a weaver; this a potter. Here, too, is a
razor-grinder; here an iron-worker. Labour is their lot;
labour they yearn for, though to some of them labour comes
with miserable disease and early death. Have we not here
Knights of the Shuttle, Knights of Clay, and Knights of
Vulcan, who prepare the carcase of the giant engine for its
vital flood of steam? Are not these among the noblest of
the sons of Poverty? Shall they not take high rank in its
Order?</p>

<p class='c010'>We are at the mouth of a mine. There, many, many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>fathoms below us, works the naked, grimed, and sweating
wretch, oppressed, brutalised, that he may dig us coal for
our winter’s hearth; where we may gather round, and with
filled bellies, well-clothed backs, and hearts all lapped in
self-complacency, talk of the talked-of evils of the world,
as though they were the fables of ill-natured men, and not
the verities of bleeding life. That these men, doing the
foulest offices of the world should still be of the world’s
poorest, gives dignity to want—the glory of long-suffering
to poverty.</p>

<p class='c010'>And so, indeed, in the mind of wisdom, is poverty
ennobled. And for the Knights of the Golden Calf,
how are they outnumbered! Let us, then, revive the
Order of Poverty. Ponder, reader, on its antiquity.
For was not Christ Himself Chancellor of the Order,
and the Apostles Knights Companions?</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>THE OLD MAN AT THE GATE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>In</span> Surrey, some three miles from Chertsey, is a quiet, dull,
sequestered nook, called Shepperton Green. Whether the
new philanthropy of new pauper laws hath, of late years,
sought out the spot I know not. At the time whereof I
write, the olden charity dwelt in an old workhouse—a
primitive abiding-place for the broken ploughman, the
palsied shepherd, the old, old peasant, for whom nothing
more remained in this world but to die. The governor of
this abode of benevolence dwelt in the lower part of the
building, and therein, as the village trade might fluctuate,
made or mended shoes. Let the plain truth be said—the
governor was a cobbler. Within a stone’s cast of the
workhouse was a little white gate swung between two
hedge-banks in the road to Chertsey. Here, pass when
you would, stood an old man, whose self-imposed office
it was to open the gate; for the which service the passenger
would drop some small benevolence in the withered hand of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>the aged peasant. This man was a pauper—one of the
almsmen of the village workhouse.</p>
<p class='c010'>There was a custom—whether established by the governor
aforesaid or by predecessors of a vanished century, I know
not—that made it the privilege of the oldest pauper to stand
the porter at the gate; his perquisite, by right of years, the
halfpence of the rare pedestrian. As the senior died, the
living senior succeeded to the office. Now the gate—and
now the grave.</p>

<p class='c010'>And this is all the history? All. The story is told—it
will not bear another syllable. The “Old Man” is at
the gate; the custom which places him there has been
made known, and with it ends the narrative.</p>

<p class='c010'>How few the incidents of life—how multitudinous its
emotions! How flat, monotonous may be the circumstance
of daily existence, and yet how various the thoughts which
spring from it! Look at yonder landscape, broken into
hill and dale, with trees of every hue and form, and water
winding in silver threads through velvet fields. How
beautiful—for how various! Cast your eye over that
moor; it is flat and desolate—barren as barren rock. Not
so. Seek the soil, and then, with nearer gaze, contemplate
the wondrous forms and colours of the thousand mosses
growing there; give ear to the hum of busy life sounding
at every root of poorest grass. Listen! Does not the
heart of the earth beat audibly beneath this seeming barrenness—audibly
as where the corn grows and the grape
ripens? Is it not so with the veriest rich and the veriest
poor—with the most active and with apparently the most
inert?</p>

<p class='c010'>That “Old Man at the Gate” has eighty years upon
his head—eighty years, covering it with natural reverence.
He was once in London—only once. This pilgrimage
excepted, he has never journeyed twenty miles from the
cottage in which he was born; of which he became the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>master; whereto he brought his wife; where his children
saw the light, and their children after; where many of
them died; and whence, having with a stout soul, fought
against the strengthening ills of poverty and old age, he
was thrust by want and sickness out, and, with a stung
heart, he laid his bones upon a workhouse bed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Life to the “Old Man” has been one long path across
a moor—a flat, unbroken journey; the eye uncheered,
the heart unsatisfied. Coldness and sterility have compassed
him round. Yet, has he been subdued to the blankness
of his destiny? Has his mind remained the unwrit page
that schoolmen talk of—has his heart become a clod?
Has he been made by poverty a moving image—a plough-guiding,
corn-thrashing instrument? Have not unutterable
thoughts sometimes stirred within his brain—thoughts
that elevated, yet confused him with a sense of eternal
beauty—coming upon him like the spiritual presences to
the shepherds? Has he not been beset by the inward
and mysterious yearning of the heart towards the unknown
and the unseen? He has been a ploughman. In the eye
of the well-to-do, dignified with the accomplishments of
reading and writing, is he of little more intelligence than
the oxen treading the glebe. Yet, who shall say that the
influence of nature—that the glories of the rising sun—may
not have called forth harmonies of soul from the rustic
drudge, the moving statue of a man!</p>

<p class='c010'>That worn-out, threadbare remnant of humanity at the
gate; age makes it reverend, and the inevitable—shall
inevitable be said?—injustice of the world invests it with
majesty, the majesty of suffering meekly borne and meekly
decaying. “The poor shall never cease out of the land.”
This text the self-complacency of competence loveth to
quote: it hath a melody in it, a lulling sweetness to the
selfishness of our nature. Hunger, and cold, and nakedness,
are the hard portion of man; there is no help for it;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>rags must flutter about us; man, yes, even the strong man,
his only wealth (the wealth of Adam) wasting in his bones,
must hold his pauper hand to his brother of four meals
<i>per diem</i>; it is a necessity of nature, and there is no help
for it. And thus some men send their consciences to
sleep by the chinking of their own purses. Necessity of evil
is an excellent philosophy applied to everybody but—ourselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>These easy souls will see nothing in our “Old Man at
the Gate” but a pauper, let out of the workhouse for
the chance of a few halfpence. Surely, he is something
more? He is old; very old. Every day, every hour,
earth has less claim in him. He is so old, so feeble, that
even as you look he seems sinking. At sunset he is
scarcely the man who opened the gate to you in the
morning. Yet there is no disease in him—none. He is
dying of old age. He is working out that most awful
problem of life—slowly, solemnly. He is now the badged
pauper—and now in the unknown country with Solomon!</p>

<p class='c010'>Can man look upon a more touching solemnity? There
stands the old man, passive as a stone, nearer every moment
to churchyard clay! It was only yesterday that he took
his station at the gate. His predecessor held the post for
two years; he too daily, daily dying:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Till like a clock, worn out with eating time,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The weary wheels of life at length stood still.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>How long will the present watcher survive? In that
very uncertainty—in the very hoariness of age which
brings home to us that uncertainty—there is something that
makes the old man sacred; for, in the course of nature,
is not the oldest man the nearest to the angels?</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet, away from these thoughts, there is reverence due
to that old man. What has been his life? A war with
suffering. What a beautiful world is this!  How rich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>and glorious! How abundant in blessings—great and
little—to thousands! What a lovely place hath God made
it; and how have God’s creatures darkened and outraged
it to the wrong of one another! Well, what had this man
of the world? What stake, as the effrontery of selfishness
has it? The wild fox was better cared for. Though
preserved some day to be killed, it <i>was</i> preserved until
then. What did this old man inherit? Toil, incessant
toil, with no holiday of the heart: he came into the world
a badged animal of labour; the property of animals. What
was the earth to him?—a place to die in.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The poor shall never cease out of the land.” Shall
we then, accommodating our sympathies to this hard
necessity, look serenely down upon the wretched? Shall
we preach only comfort to ourselves from the doomed
condition of others? It is an easy philosophy; so easy
there is but little wonder it is so well exercised.</p>

<p class='c010'>But “The Old Man at the Gate” has, for seventy
years, worked and worked; and what his closing
reward? The workhouse. Shall we not, some of us,
blush crimson at our own world-successes, considering the
destitution of our worthy, single-hearted fellows? Should
not affluence touch its hat to “The Old Man at the Gate”
with a reverence for the years upon him; he—the born
soldier of poverty, doomed for life to lead life’s forlorn hope?
Thus considered, surely Dives may unbonnet to Lazarus.</p>

<p class='c010'>To our mind the venerableness of age made “The Old
Man at the Gate” something like a spiritual presence. He
was so old, who could say how few the pulsations of his
heart between him and the grave! But there he was with
a meek happiness upon him; gentle, cheerful. He was not
built up in bricks and mortar; but was still in the open air,
with the sweetest influences about him; the sky—the
trees—the green sward—and flowers with the breath of
God in them!</p>

nature expiates its guiltiness, its lack of worldly goods, its
most desolate perplexity; but we will take him to a
wretchedness, first contrived by wrong and perpetrated by
folly. We will show him the embryo mischief that in due
season shall be born in the completion of its terror, and
shall be christened with a sounding name,—Folly and
wickedness standing its sponsors.</p>
<p class='c010'>We are in St James’s Park. The royal standard of
England burns in the summer air—the Queen is in London.
We pass the Palace, and in a few paces are in Birdcage
Walk. There, reader, is the miserable show we promised
you. There are some fifty recruits, drilled by a sergeant to
do homicide, killingly, handsomely. In Birdcage Walk
Glory sits upon her eggs, and hatches eagles!</p>

<p class='c010'>How very beautiful is the sky above us! What a blessing
comes with the fresh, quick air! The trees, drawing their
green beauty from the earth, quicken our thoughts of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>bounteousness of this teeming world. Here in this nook,
this patch, where we yet feel the vibrations of surrounding
London—even here Nature, constant in her beauty, blooms
and smiles, uplifting the heart of man—if the heart be his
to own her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, look aside and contemplate God’s image with a
musket. Your bosom duly expanding with gratitude to
nature for the blessings she has heaped about you, behold
the crowning glory of God’s work managed, like a machine,
to slay the image of God—to stain the teeming earth with
homicidal blood—to fill the air with howling anguish! Is
not yonder row of clowns a melancholy sight? Yet are they
the sucklings of Glory—the baby mighty ones of a future
<i>Gazette</i>. Reason beholds them with a deep pity. Imagination
magnifies them into fiends of wickedness. There is
carnage about them—carnage, and the pestilential vapour of
the slaughtered. What a fine-looking thing is war! Yet
dress it as we may, dress and feather it, daub it with gold,
huzza it and sing swaggering songs about it—what is it, nine
times out of ten—but murder in uniform? Cain, taken the
sergeant’s shilling?</p>

<p class='c010'>And now we hear the fifes and drums of her Majesty’s
Grenadiers. They pass on the other side; and a crowd of
idlers, their hearts jumping to the music, their eyes dazzled,
and their feelings perverted, hang about the march and catch
the infection—the love of glory! And true wisdom thinks
of the world’s age, and sighs at its slow advance in all that
really dignifies man—the truest dignity being the truest love
for his fellow. And then hope, and faith in human progress,
contemplate the pageant, its real ghastliness disguised by
outward glare and frippery, and know the day will come
when the symbols of war will be as the sacred beasts of
old Egypt—things to mark the barbarism of bygone war;
melancholy records of the past perversity of human nature.</p>

<p class='c010'>We can imagine the deep-chested laughter—the look of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>scorn which would annihilate, and then the smile of compassion—of
the man of war at this, the dream of folly and
the wanderings of an inflamed brain. Yet, oh, man of war!
at this very moment are you shrinking, withering like an
aged giant. The fingers of Opinion have been busy at
your plume—you are not the feathered thing you were;
and then that little tube, the goose quill, has sent its silent
shot into your huge anatomy; and the corroding <span class='small'>INK</span>, even
whilst you look at it, and think it shines so brightly, is
eating with a tooth of rust into your sword.</p>

<p class='c010'>That a man should kill a man and rejoice in the deed—nay,
gather glory from it—is the act of a wild animal. The
force of muscle and the dexterity of limb which make the
wild man a conqueror are deemed, in savage life, man’s
highest attributes. The creature whom, in the pride of our
Christianity, we call heathen and spiritually desolate, has
some personal feeling in the strife—he kills his enemy, and
then, making an oven of hot stones, bakes his dead body,
and, for crowning satisfaction, eats it. His enemy becomes
a part of him; his glory is turned to nutriment; and he is
content. What barbarism! Field-marshals sicken at the
horror; nay, troopers shudder at the tale, like a fine lady at
a toad.</p>

<p class='c010'>In what, then, consists the prime evil? In the murder,
or in the meal? Which is the most hideous deed—to kill
a man, or to cook and eat the man when killed?</p>

<p class='c010'>But, softly, there is no murder in the case. The craft of
man has made a splendid ceremony of homicide—has
invested it with dignity. He slaughters with flags flying,
drums beating, trumpets braying. He kills according to
method, and has worldly honours for his grim handiwork.
He does not, like the unchristian savage, carry away with
him mortal trophies from the skulls of his enemies. No,
the alchemy and magic of authority turns his well-won
scalps into epaulets, or hangs them in stars and crosses at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>his button-hole; and then, the battle over, the dead not
eaten, but carefully buried—and the maimed and mangled
howling and blaspheming in hospitals—the meek Christian
warrior marches to church, and reverently folding his sweet
and spotless hands, sings <i>Te Deum</i>. Angels wave his
fervent thanks to God, to whose footstool—in his own faith—he
has so lately sent his shuddering thousands. And this
spirit of destruction working within him is canonised by the
craft and ignorance of man and worshipped as glory!</p>

<p class='c010'>And this religion of the sword—this dazzling heathenism,
that makes a pomp of wickedness—seizes and distracts us
even on the threshold of life. Swords and drums are our
baby playthings; the types of violence and destruction are
made the pretty pastimes of our childhood; and as we grow
older, the outward magnificence of the ogre Glory—his trappings
and his trumpets, his privileges, and the songs that
are shouted in his praise—ensnare the bigger baby to his
sacrifice. Hence slaughter becomes an exalted profession;
the marked, distinguished employment of what in the jargon
of the world is called a gentleman.</p>
<div id='i175'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i175.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“Hodge, poor fellow, enlists”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c009'>But for this craft operating upon this ignorance, who—in
the name of outraged God—would become the hireling of
the Sword? Hodge, poor fellow, enlists. He wants work;
or he is idle, dissolute. Kept, by the injustice of the world,
as ignorant as the farmyard swine, he is the better instrument
for the world’s craft. His ear is tickled with the fife
and drum; or he is drunk; or the sergeant—the lying
valet of glory—tells a good tale, and already Hodge is a
warrior in the rough. In a fornight’s time you may see
him at Chatham; or indeed he was one of those we marked
in Birdcage Walk. Day by day the sergeant works at the
block ploughman, and, chipping and chipping, at length
carves out a true, handsome soldier of the line. What
knew Hodge of the responsibility of man? What dreams
had he of the self-accountability of the human spirit? He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>is become the lackey of carnage, the liveried footman, at a
few pence per day, of fire and blood. The musket stock,
which for many an hour he hugs—hugs in sulks and weariness—was
no more a party to its present use than was Hodge.
That piece of walnut is the fragment of a tree that might
have given shade and fruit for another century; homely,
rustic people gathering under it. Now it is the instrument
of wrong and violence; the working tool of slaughter.
Tree and man, are not their destinies as one?</p>

<p class='c010'>And is Hodge alone of benighted mind? Is he alone
deficient of that knowledge of moral right and wrong, which
really and truly crowns the man king of himself? When
he surrenders up his nature, a mere machine with human
pulses to do the bidding of war, has he taken counsel with
his own reflection—does he know the limit of the sacrifice?
He has taken his shilling, and knows the facings of his
uniform!</p>

<p class='c010'>When the born and bred gentleman, to keep to coined
and current terms, pays down his thousand pounds or so
for his commission, what incites to the purchase? It may
be the elegant idleness of the calling: it may be the bullion
and glitter of the regimentals; or, devout worshipper, it
may be an unquenchable thirst for glory. From the
moment when his name stars the <i>Gazette</i>, what does he
become? The bond-servant of war! Instantly he ceases
to be a judge between moral right and moral injury. It is
his duty not to think, but to obey. He has given up,
surrendered to another the freedom of his soul: he has
dethroned the majesty of his own will. He must be active
in wrong, and see not the injustice: shed blood for craft
and usurpation, calling bloodshed valour. He may be
made, by the iniquity of those who use him, a burglar and
a brigand; but glory calls him pretty names for his prowess,
and the wicked weakness of the world shouts and acknowledges
him. And is this the true condition of reasonable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>man? Is it by such means that he best vindicates the greatness
of his mission here? Is he when he most gives up the
free motions of his own soul—is he then most glorious?</p>

<p class='c010'>A few months ago chance showed us a band of ruffians
who, as it afterwards appeared, were intent upon most
desperate mischief. They spread themselves over the
country, attacking, robbing, and murdering all who fell
into their hands. Men, women, and children all suffered
alike. Nor were the villains satisfied with this. In their
wanton ruthlessness they set fire to cottages, and tore up
and destroyed plantations. Every footpace of their march
was marked with blood and desolation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Who were these wretches? you ask. What place did
they ravage? Were they not caught and punished?</p>

<p class='c010'>They were a part of the army of Africa; valorous Frenchmen,
bound for Algiers to cut Arab throats; and, in the
name of glory, and for the everlasting glory of France, to
burn, pillage, and despoil; and all for national honour—all
for glory!</p>

<p class='c010'>But Glory cannot dazzle Truth. Does it not at times
appear no otherwise than a highwayman with a pistol at
a nation’s breast? a burglar with a crowbar entering a
kingdom? Alas! in this world there is no Old Bailey for
nations, otherwise where would have been the crowned
heads that divided Poland? Those felon monarchs
anointed to—steal? It is true the historian claps the
cutpurse conqueror in the dock, and he is tried by the
jury of posterity. <i>He</i> is past the verdict, yet is not its
damnatory voice lost upon generations? For thus is the
world taught—albeit slowly taught—true glory; when that
which passed for virtue is truly tested to be vile; when the
hero is hauled from the car and fixed for ever in the
pillory.</p>

<p class='c010'>But war brings forth the heroism of the soul: war tests
the magnanimity of man.  Sweet is the humanity that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>spares a fallen foe; gracious the compassion that tends
his wounds, that brings even a cup of water to his burning
lips. Granted. But is there not a heroism of a grander
mould—the heroism of forbearance? Is not the humanity
that refuses to strike a nobler virtue than the late pity born
of violence? Pretty is it to see the victor with salve and
lint kneeling at his bloody trophy—a maimed and agonised
fellow-man; but surely it had been better to withhold the
blow than to have been first mischievous, to be afterwards
humane.</p>

<p class='c010'>That nations professing a belief in Christ should couple
glory with war is monstrous blasphemy. Their faith, their
professing faith, is—“Love one another”; their practice is
to—cut throats; and more, to bribe and hoodwink men to
the wickedness, the trade of blood is magnified into a
virtue. We pray against battle, and glorify the deeds of
death. We say beautiful are the ways of peace, and then
cocker ourselves upon our perfect doings in the art of
man-slaying. Let us then cease to pay the sacrifice of
admiration to the demon—War; let us not acknowledge
him as a mighty and majestic principle, but, at the very
best, a grim and melancholy necessity.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there always has been—there always will be—war.
It is inevitable; it is a part of the condition of human
society. Man has always made glory to himself from the
destruction of his fellow; so it will continue. It may be
very pitiable; would it were otherwise! But so it is, and
there is no helping it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Happily we are slowly killing this destructive fallacy. A
long breathing time of peace has been fatal to the dread
magnificence of glory. Science and philosophy—<i>povera e
nuda filosofia!</i>—have made good their claims, inducing
man to believe that he may vindicate the divinity of his
nature otherwise than by perpetrating destruction. He
begins to think there is a better glory in the communication
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>of triumphs of the mind, than in the clash of steel and the
roar of artillery. At the present moment a society, embracing
men of distant nations—“natural enemies,” as the
old wicked cant of the old patriotism had it—is at work
plucking the plumes from Glory, unbracing his armour,
and divesting the ogre of all that dazzled foolish and
unthinking men, showing the rascal in his natural hideousness,
in all his base deformity. Some, too, are calculating
the cost of Glory’s table: some showing what an appetite
the demon has, devouring at a meal the substance of these
thousand sons of industry—yea, eating up the wealth of
kingdoms. And thus by degrees are men beginning to
look upon this god Glory as no more than a finely-trapped
Sawney Bean—a monster and a destroyer—a nuisance—a
noisy lie.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>THE GREENWICH PENSIONER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>A Greenwich</span> pensioner! Did any of my readers ever
ponder on that strange composition of battered humanity
and blue serge? Did they never feel a something approaching
very near gratitude on passing, in the metropolis, a
Greenwich pensioner, who, with his honest, carved out,
unabashed front, looks as bluntly and as wonderingly at the
bustle and splendour around him as does an unsophisticated
wether suddenly removed from South Downs to Cheapside,
whilst shaking his woollen coat beneath the whip of the
coachman to the Lord Mayor. What a mixture of gravity
and wonderment is in the poor brute’s countenance! how
with its meek, uplifted head it stares at the effulgent vehicle,—runs
leaping at the coach-wheels, mistaking them for
hurdles,—falls, awe-struck, back, at the gilt and beavered
greatness of the footman’s cocked hat,—then, suddenly
awakened from its amazement by the lurcher’s teeth, or
the driver’s stick, makes an unlucky spring of some three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>feet into the air, catches a glance of its figure in the
mirrored walls of a silk mercer, and, startled at the sight,
dashes through the first court,—carrying perhaps a few
yards upon its back some red-faced, nankeen-gaitered little
stockbroker, whose spattered small clothes are for a time
unregarded in the mighty rush of drovers, butchers, dogs,
and idlers.</p>
<p class='c010'>Now such is the real Greenwich pensioner. When I say
<i>real</i>, I mean one who abhors London worse than he does a
Frenchman; who thinks there is nothing to be seen in it,
unless, indeed, it be Nelson’s tomb, in St Paul’s, or the
“Ship” public-house, in Tooley Street. London is to
him a never-failing source of merriment; that is, whilst he
is out of it. He sits at Greenwich, and looking as sagely
as a starling ere he snaps at a fly, at the piled-up clouds
of smoke hanging over the metropolis, or, indeed, almost
propped upon its chimney-pots, and, stretching forth his
stick, significantly points them out to his former shipmates,
asking them if they do not think “there is something dark
over there—something of an ‘ox-eye’ to the west?” He,
indeed, never ventures to London, unless it be for a fresh
supply of tobacco, or to pay a quarterly visit to his grand-daughter,
the upper housemaid in a gentleman’s family,—and
who, indeed, thinks with horror upon his call, because
the neighbours laugh at the cocked hat and the shoe-buckles
of her relative; but principally because Richard,
the baker’s young man, declares he hates all sailors. The
visit is never a very lengthened one, especially if the girl
lives far to the west; for her grandfather has to call upon
Will Somebody, who set up, with his prize-money, a
public-house in Wapping. So off he starts, hurries up the
Strand, touches his hat from a point of principle as he
nears Somerset House; puts out more canvas, and away
for Temple Bar. The pensioner has not yet, however, sat
for his picture.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>We have all read of crabs being despoiled of their claws,
locusts of their entrails, and turtles of their brains, receiving
in lieu thereof a pellet of cotton, and yet retaining life, and
appearing, in the words of the experimentalising and soft-hearted
naturalist, “very lively and comfortable.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c017'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Now,
the real Greenwich pensioner distances all these; he is,
indeed, an enigma: nature knows not what to make of
him. He hath been suspended, like a school-boy’s bob-cherry,
a hundred times over the chaps of death, and yet
still been snatched away by the hand of Providence—to
whom, indeed, his many hurts and dangers have especially
endeared him. Ye of the “<i>land</i> interest,” ye soft-faced
young sparks, who think with terror upon a razor on a
frosty morning,—ye suffering old gentlemen, who pause at
a linen-draper’s, and pass the flannel between your fingers,
as time verges towards October—ye martyrs to a winter
cough, ye racked with a quarterly toothache—all ye of
household ailings, look upon this hacked, shivered piece of
clay, this Greenwich pensioner:—consider of how many of
his powers he is despoiled—see where the cutlass and the
boarding-spike have ploughed up and pierced his flesh; see
where the bullet has glanced, singeing by; and when you
have reckoned up—if they are to be reckoned—his many
scars, above all, look at his hard, contented, weather-barnacled
face, and then, gentle spectators, complain of
your rheums, your joint-twitchings, and your corns!</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f10'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See <i>Vaillant</i> and <i>Redi</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Why, this Greenwich pensioner is in himself a record
of the last forty years’ war. He is a breathing volume of
naval history: not an event but is somewhere indented in
him with steel or lead: he has been the stick in which
the English Mars has notched his cricket matches, when
twenty-four pounders were balls, and mainmasts wickets.
See, in his blinded eye is Howe’s victory on the glorious
First of June; that stump of what was once an arm is Nile;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>and in his wooden leg read Trafalgar. As to his scars, a
gallant action, or a desperate cutting out is noted in every
one of them. And what was the old fellow’s only wish,
as with a shattered knee he lay in the cock-pit under the
surgeon’s hand—what was his earnest supplication to the
wet-eyed messmate who bore him down the hatchway?
Simply that he would save him one of the splinters of the
mainmast of the <i>Victory</i>, to make of it a leg for Sundays!
His wish was granted; and at Greenwich, always on the
seventh day, and also on the 21st of October, is he to be
seen, propped upon the inestimable splinter, which from
labour, time, and beeswax, has taken the dark glossiness of
mahogany. What a face he has! What a certain consciousness
of his superiority on his own element at times puffs out
his lip, and gives a sudden twitch to his head! But ask
him in what quarter sets the wind—and note, how with his
one eye he will glance at you from top to toe; and, without
ever raising his head or hand to make a self-inquiry,
answers you at once, as though it was a question he was
already prepared for! And so, indeed, he is; it being his
first business, on rising, to consult the weather. The only
way to gain his entire confidence, is at once frankly to avow
your utter ignorance, and his superiority; and then, after he
has leered at you with an eye in which there is a meeting of
contempt, good-humour, and self-importance, he is wholly
your own; and will straightway launch into the South Seas,
coast along the shores of Guinea,—where, by-the-bye, he
will tell you he once fell in love with a negress, who, however,
jilted him for the cook—and then he will launch out
about Admiral Duncan—take you a voyage with him round
Cape Horn, where a mermaid appeared, and sang a song to
the ship’s crew; and who, indeed, blew aside all the musket
shots that were ungallantly fired at her in requital of her
melody. But our pensioner has one particular story; hear
him through that, suffer yourself to be wholly astounded at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>its recital, and, if you were not a landsman, he would
instantly greet you as his dearest friend. The heroes of
this same story are, our pensioner and a shark: a tremendous
shark that used to be the terror of the harbour of St
Thomas’s. Upon this shark, and the piece of the mainmast
of the <i>Victory</i>, is our pensioner content to rest all his
importance during his life, and his fame with posterity. He
will tell you that he, being caterer of the mess, let fall a
piece of beef out at the port-hole, which this terrible shark
received into its jaws, and twisted its body most provokingly
at the delicious mouthful. Hereupon our pensioner—it
was before, he reminds you, he had lost a limb—asks
leave of the first lieutenant (for the captain was ashore) to
have a bout with the shark: leave being granted, all the
crew are quickly in the shrouds, and upon the hammock
netting, to see Tom “tackle the shark.” Our pensioner
now enters into a minute detail of how, having armed himself
with a long knife, he jumped overboard, dived under
the shark, whom he saw approaching with distended jaws,
and inflicted a tremendous wound with the knife in the belly
of the fish; this is repeated thrice, when the shark turns
itself upon its back—a boat is let down, and both the conqueror
and the conquered are quickly received upon deck.
You are doubtless astonished at this; he, however, adds to
your surprise by telling you that the mess regaled off the
piece of beef recovered from the fish; be more astounded
at this, although mingle no doubt in your astonishment, and
he will straightway promise some day to treat your eyes
with a sight of a set of chequer men, cut from the very
dorsal bone of the immolated shark! To be the hearer of
a sailor’s tale is something like undergoing the ancient
ordeal of red-hot ploughshares; be innocent of unbelief,
and you may, as was held, journey in safety; doubt the
smallest point, and you are quickly withered into nought.</p>

<p class='c010'>What an odd contrast to his early life is the state of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Greenwich pensioner! It is as though a part of the angry
and foaming sea should lie stagnant in a bathing tub. All
his business is to recount his former adventures—to plod
about, and look with a disdainful eye at trees and bricks and
mortar; or, when he would indulge in a serious fit of spleen,
to walk down to the river’s side, and let his gall feed upon
the mishaps of London apprentices, who, fearless of consequences,
may have ventured some five miles from home in
<i>not</i> a “trim-built wherry.” A Greenwich pensioner fresh
from sea is a most preposterous creature; he gets up
every morning for a week, a month, and still finds himself
in the same place; he knows not what to make of it—he
feels the strangeness of his situation, and would, had he
the patience and the wit, liken himself to a hundred
unsettled things. Compare him to a hippopotamus in a
gentleman’s park, and he would tell you he had in his day
seen a hippopotamus, and then, with a good-natured grunt,
acquiesce in the resemblance; or to a jolly-boat in a flower
garden; or to a sea-gull in the cage of a canary; or to a
porpoise upon a hearthrug; or to a boatswain’s whistle in a
nursery; or to a marling-spike in a milliner’s workroom; or
a tar-barrel in a confectioner’s; with any one or all of these
misplaced articles would our unsettled pensioner sympathise,
until time shall have reconciled him to his asylum; and
even then his fancy, like the shells upon our mantelpiece,
will sound of the distant and the dangerous ocean. At
Greenwich, however, the mutilated old sailor has time
enough to indulge in the recollection of his early days, and,
with what wisdom he may, to make up his mind to meet in
another world those whom his arm may have sent thither
long before. Death, at length, gently lays the veteran upon
his back—his last words, as the sailor puts his withered
hand upon his heart, are “All’s well,” and sea and earth
have passed away. His body, which had been for forty
years a bulwark to the land, now demands of it but “two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>paces of the vilest earth”; and if aught could spring from
the tomb characteristic of its inmate, from the grave of the
pensioner would arise the stout, unbending oak—it would
be his fitting monument; and the carolling of the birds in
its branches would be his loud, his artless epitaph.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Greenwich pensioner, wherever we meet with him,
is a fine, quaint memento of our national greatness, and our
fortunate locality. We should look upon him as the representative
of Neptune, and bend our spirit towards him
accordingly. But that is not sufficient; we have individual
acknowledgments to make to him for the comforts of a long
safety. Let us but consider, as we look at his wooden supporter,
that if it had not been for his leg the cannon-ball
might have scattered us in our tea parlour—the bullet which
deprived him of his orb of vision might have stricken <i>Our
Village</i> from our hand whilst ensconced in our study; the
cutlass which cleaved his shoulder might have demolished
our china vase, or our globe of golden fish:—instead of
which, hemmed round by such walls of stout and honest
flesh, we have lived securely, participating in every peaceful
and domestic comfort, and neither heard the roar of the
cannon nor seen its smoke. Shakespeare has compared
England to “a swan’s nest” in the “world’s pool”: let us
be nautical in our similes, and liken her to a single lemon
kernel in a huge bowl of punch: who is it that has prevented
the kernel from being ladled down the throat of despotism,
from becoming but an atom of the great, loathsome mass?—our
Greenwich pensioner. Who has kept our houses from
being transformed into barracks and our cabbage markets
into parades?—again, and again, let it be answered, the
Greenwich pensioner. Reader, if the next time you see
the tar, you should perchance have with you your wife and
smiling family, think that if their tenderness has never been
shocked by scenes of blood and terror, you owe such
quietude to a Greenwich pensioner. Indeed, I know not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>if a triennial progress of the Greenwich establishment
through the whole kingdom would not be attended with
the most beneficial effects—fathers would teach their little
ones to lisp thanksgivings unto God that they were born in
England, as reminded of their happy superiority by the
withered form of every Greenwich pensioner.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>THE DRILL SERGEANT</h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Shall</span> we view our subject through the glasses of philosophy?
Precious microscopic glasses, by which we look
into the exquisite order of a bee’s weapon, which shames
the ruggedness of that vaunted wonder of man’s hands—a
Whitechapel needle. By which the superfine coat of the
unworthy appears but as a vile complication of coarse hemp-strings;
by which we look into the heart that to the naked
eye displays a tenanted cherub, with voice of music and
wings of light, but find a weak-eyed little monster, with
squeak of mouse and pinions of leather. O, glorious spectacles!
which show palaces not entirely as resting-places
for divinities—many laurels as nettles, stinging what they
are fancied to adorn—Fame’s trumpet, a penny whistle
blown by Asthma—the awful person of Ceremony, a
Merry-Andrew stricken grave—a grand review-day, a
game at ninepins on an extensive scale—a levee, a triumph
of the laceman and jeweller—a court ode, a verbose receipt
for wages—“honourable gentleman,” convicted scoundrel—“learned
friend,” stupid opponent—a prison, a temporary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>retirement from noise—a glass of spring water, a “cup of
sack”—an ugly face, God’s own handiwork—a handsome
one, nothing more—noble blood, of the same hue as a
carter’s—a black parish coffin, a couch of crystal—a grave,
a place of rest—consecrated earth, the whole globe—a
tombstone, work for the mason—a pompous epitaph, the
toil of a liar! This transformation—or rather, this showing
of reality—is the result of using the glasses of philosophy.
Without the common microscope we could not know how
certain insects respired, whether at the mouth or shoulders;
wanting philosophy’s optic, we should be in like ignorance
of the source of being in some men—for all exist not by
the same laws. To the naked eye, indeed, there appears
no difference; but to the spectacled orb of philosophy it is
shown that many men respire, not by inward organisation,
but by external and adventitious instruments. Let those
who are sceptical on this position consider for a moment
the bearing of a thorough-paced coxcomb: does he breathe
from his lungs? No; but from his habiliments. His coat,
cravat, boots—yea, his spurs, are the sources of his being,
his dignity, his action. Nay, some men take all their life
from a riband at their button-hole, or a garter at their leg.—Our
Drill Sergeant takes it from his rattan.</p>
<p class='c010'>I know that much of this may be deemed foreign to the
purpose. To those who so conclude, I say—A common
wire-dancer gives not his grand feat without many little
nick-nack preparations. When we visit the Egyptian
Hall, that grand emporium of monsters, we do not step
from the pavement into the show-room, but are wisely
made to thread two or three passages for the better excitation
of our feelings. And shall my Drill Sergeant have
not the common observance paid to a mermaid? I trust I
have more respect for my subject, and the army in general.
If any one of my readers, when he glanced at the title,
thought to meet with the Sergeant standing bolt upright at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>the beginning of the line, like the sentinel at Buckingham
Gate, I luxuriate in his disappointment.</p>

<p class='c010'>To be candid: I had laid down no form for my beginning;
so I thought a caper or two upon philosophy would
not be amiss, trusting eventually to drop upon my subject.
This is a trick frequently played by ——. However, to
business.</p>

<p class='c010'>We must contemplate the Drill Sergeant at a distance:
there is no closing with him. A painter would decline a
chair in the tiger’s den, asserting that he could take the
animal’s stripes equally well through the bars. Even so
will I take the stripes of our Sergeant. First, to consider
his appearance, or rather the discipline by which his “thews
and muscles” deport themselves. He has a vile, cat-like
leer of the eye, that makes us retreat back a few paces, and
rub our palms, to be assured the knave has not secretly
placed in one of them a shilling. We tremble, and for
once are afraid to meet the king’s countenance—(I am
adding to the awful attributes of the Drill Sergeant the
fearful privilege of recruiting). We shrink, lest he has
mentally approved of us as being worthy of ball cartridge.
He glances towards our leg, and we cannot but feel that he
is thinking how it would look in a black gaiter. At this
moment we take courage, and, valiantly lifting off our hat,
pass our luxuriant curls through our four fingers—we are
petrified; for we see by his chuckle that he has already
doomed our tresses to the scissors of the barrack-barber.
We are at once about to take to our legs, when, turning
round, we see something under a middle-sized man, looking
over our head. On this we feel our safety, and triumph
in the glory of five feet one. Something must always be
allowed for weakness—something for vanity; which, indeed,
philosophers denominate the greatest weakness.
Hence all these cogitations, foolishly attributed by the
little individual to the Sergeant, arise from the civil man’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>self-conceit; the Sergeant always treating with ineffable
contempt persons of a certain size. And here may be
remarked the astonishing capacity of our Sergeant in judging
of human altitude. Ere George Bidder can enumerate the
virtues of King Ferdinand, our Sergeant will sum up the
exact height of a man, duly allowing for his pumps and
silk stockings. Strive to mystify the question, and the
ability of the Sergeant mocks the endeavour; for, he will,
on a minute’s notice, resolve how many feet of martial flesh
are in a complete square, after including the triangle, fife,
and drummer lads, and deducting some of the boy officers.
Thus, five-feet-eight reader, if thou wouldst enjoy the
pranks of the Sergeant, unmolested by his eye, teach thy
leg to mimic lameness: or, if easier, cough consumptively.</p>

<p class='c010'>I would wish to convey a striking resemblance of our
Drill Sergeant on duty, when you would swear by his gait
that this glorious earth was wholly composed of spring
wires, so elastic are his soles. It is a motion unparalleled
either in the natural or artificial world; it is a movement
by itself—like the swoop of the eagle, the waddle of the
duck, the fleetness of the greyhound, or the hop of the frog.
And yet, on intense consideration, I think I have seen
something approximating to the bearing of our Drill
Sergeant. What think you of the manner of a pug dog
in a dropsy, exposed for air on a nipping December
morning, his black nose turning almost white with indignation
at the coldness of the flags?—There certainly is a
resemblance; there is dignity in both animals, albeit to the
daring eye of a grotesque character. It must, however,
be owned, that on great occasions our Sergeant can alter his
deportment. It is not in the nature of things to be always
strained to the highest: the distended skin of the serpent
at times falls into amiable and social wrinkles; an arrant
shrew may sometimes be caught singing “<i>Sweet Home!</i>”
the bow-string of a William Tell may be doubtless as relaxed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>and tuneless as the instrument of a Haymarket fiddler;—and
shall not our Sergeant unbend? He does break
himself up from the stiffness of parade; for see him when
the draughts of mine hostess hath diluted some portion of
military starch, and he no longer holds his head like a
game-cock, taking his morning’s potation; see him then,
and own that even a Sergeant may be amiable. Is he not
the very model of elegant ease? He is, indeed, unbent;
for his limbs swing loosely as hung ramrods. Our Sergeant
can now talk; his tongue hath overleapt the two barriers,
“Attention!” and “Stand at ease!” and rambles wildly
from Egypt to Waterloo. And if it should happen that the
pretty barmaid be niece to the landlady, mark how the
Sergeant probes for her feelings with charged bayonets—how
he will try to smite her gentle ear with a discharge of
artillery—swear that he hath had twenty wounds under his
coat, although very politically adding that they have left
him not a bit the worse man. Then, if the damsel still
continue untouched, taking orders with a calm air, our
Sergeant hints in a whisper, audible to the dozing watchman
at the door, something about a Spanish widow at
Saragossa; adding very loudly, “But no—I was always
for true love!” adorning the beautiful edifice of principle
with a flowery oath. He then begins a sentiment, and, at
a loss, dives for the conclusion to it in a pot of ale. If
there happen to be four or five privates in the room, our
Sergeant increases in importance from the circumstance—just
as a cat becomes great from the introduction of a litter
of puppies. Our Sergeant is more than ever the leading
gander of the flock—the king-herring of the shoal—the
blue-bottle of the swarm—the pebble of the sand—the G
of the gamut. He has now additional hearers of the tales
of his prowess, and, if he but give the wink, companions
who saw him face the breach and spike the cannon. His
rank next becomes the subject of discussion; and looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>very complacently at his arm, he tells of some dreadful
exploit in which he earned his stripes. “And doubtless,
Sergeant, not before you deserved them,” ventures a small,
quiet wight in the corner, who will have his fling, though at
the expense of his liquor; for ere he concludes his remark
he gives the Sergeant his glass—just as a schoolboy, who
twitches the trunk of an elephant, throws to the animal a
peace-offering of apples—whilst the privates inwardly laugh
at the joke, and get rebuked for again enjoying it on parade
to-morrow morning. Just as the Sergeant’s opponents are
nearly all slaughtered, a little Italian boy, bearing a tortoise,
adroitly glides into the room to display the testaceous
wonder; or he has with him a bust of Napoleon, at which
our Sergeant bristles up, looking, indeed, seriously fierce at
plaster of Paris. Here he utters some half-audible wish
that he had not received a bullet in the last charge, and
then——Now, however, our Sergeant takes an opportunity
to pour forth his learning—he mangles five words of
French; the Italian shakes his head, and holds forth his
hand; the Sergeant swears at him for an impostor, ignorant
of his own language. It drawing late, our Sergeant calls
for his reckoning, and, learning the amount, with an affected
air of destitution avows he has no money; he has not a
piece of silver about him, unless it be that at his breast—and
here he carelessly lifts up with one finger a Waterloo
medal;—then he draws out a watch, once the property of a
French general slain by our Sergeant, and asks if that will
serve for the amount? At length, however, the money
being shaken from a yellow silk purse, our Sergeant, after a
salutary admonition to the privates, goes off, as he says, to
visit a friend in the Ordnance.</p>
<div id='i195'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i195.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>He is, indeed, unbent.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c009'>Now this is the utmost stretch of our Sergeant’s amiability;
and he departs with a consciousness of having made
himself remarkably agreeable, at the same time that he has
maintained the proper dignity of the army. To-morrow he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>is stiff and stately again, performing his old duty of setting
up in due order men for the sport of War, that fearful
skittle-player. And, indeed, how great must be the satisfaction
of the Drill Sergeant when he thinks that, by
his kindly solicitude, his Majesty’s subjects will “die
with decency” and “in close order.” Soothing reflection!</p>

<p class='c010'>We may liken a Recruiting Sergeant to a sturdy woodman—a
Drill Sergeant to a carpenter. Let us take a dozen
vigorous young elms, with the same number of bluff-cheeked,
straddling rustics. How picturesque and inviting do the
green waving elms appear! Whilst we look at them our
love and admiration of the natural so wholly possess us that
we cannot for a moment bring ourselves to imagine the
most beautiful offspring of teeming earth cut up into boot-jacks
or broom-handles: in the very idea there is sacrilege to
the sylvan deities. The woodman, however, lays the axe to
the elms (the forest groans at the slaughter); the carpenter
comes up with his basket of tools across his shoulder; and
at a Christmas dinner we may by chance admire the extraordinary
polish of our eating knife, little thinking it owes its
lustre to the elm which shadowed us at midsummer. Now
for our rustics. We meet them in green lanes, striding like
young ogres—carelessness in their very hat-buckles—a scorn
of ceremony in the significant tuck-up of their smock-frock.
The Recruiting Sergeant spirits them away from fields to
which they were the chief adornment, and the Drill Sergeant
begins his labour.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now, reader, behold some martial carpentry and
joinery. Our Drill Sergeant hath but few implements: as
eye, voice, hand, leg, rattan. These few tools serve him for
every purpose, and with them he brings down a human
carcass, though at first as unwieldy as a bull, to the slimness
and elegance of the roe. There are the dozen misshapen
logs before him; the foliage of their heads gone with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>elm leaves, as also their bark—their “rough pash,”—the
frocks and wide breeches.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mercy on us! there was a stroke of handiwork! the
Sergeant with but one word has driven a wedge into the
very breast of that pale-looking youngster, whose eyelid
shakes as though it would dam up a tear! Perhaps the
poor wretch is now thinking of yellow corn and harvest
home. Another skilful touch, and the Sergeant hath fairly
chiselled away some inches off the shoulder of that flaxen-headed
tyro: and see how he is rounding off that mottled
set of knuckles, whilst the owner redly, but dumbly, sympathises
with their sufferings. There is no part left
untouched by our Sergeant; he by turns, saws, planes,
pierces, and thumps every limb and every joint; applies
scouring paper to any little knot or ruggedness, until man,
glorious man, the “paragon of animals,” fears no competition
in stateliness of march, or glibness of movement, from
either peacock or Punch.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Drill Sergeant hath but little complacency in him;
he is a thing to be reverenced, not doted upon; we fear
him and his mysteries; even his good humour startles, for
it is at once as blustering and as insignificant as a report of
a blank cartridge. Again, I say, the Drill Sergeant is to be
approached with awe; smirking flies the majesty of his
rattan. He is the despot of joints; and we rub our hands
with glee, and our very toes glow again, when we reflect
they are not of his dominions.</p>

<p class='c027'>By the late Captain Barabbas Whitefeather. Late of
the body-guard of his Majesty, King Carlos;
Treasurer of the British Wine and Vinegar
Company; Trustee for the protection of the
River Thames from incendiaries; principal inventor
of Poyais stock; Ranger of St

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>The</span> editor has disciplined himself to receive with becoming
moderation the tremendous expression of national gratitude
consequent on the publication of this valuable work—the
production of the late estimable Captain Barabbas Whitefeather.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>It was discovered among many other papers
accidentally left at the lodgings of the deceased, and placed
in the hands of the editor by the executors of the lamented
and—if a novel epithet may be applied to him—talented
author.</p>
<p class='c010'>When “handbooks” devoted to the lighter elegancies,
nay, to the frivolities, of life are every day poured down
upon a thankful generation, it would indeed be to incur the
charge of poltroonery to doubt the brilliant success of the
present essay.</p>

<p class='c010'>The philosophical observer who has witnessed the fervent
welcome accorded by a British public to “The Handbook
of Skittles,” “The Handbook of Cheese-Toasting,” “The
Handbook of Eel-Skinning,” “The Handbook of Nutmeg-Grating,”
“The Handbook of Corn-Cutting,” “The Handbook
of Kitten-Drowning,” and other productions of lesser
pith and purpose,—the philosophic observer cannot but
glow with the sweetest and liveliest feelings of anticipated
pleasure at the outburst of national gratitude acknowledging
and rejoicing in the publication of</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>“<span class='sc'>The Handbook of Swindling.</span>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Let us for a moment consider the comprehensiveness of
the subject. Other handbooks have their merits and their
uses: far be it from the editor to detract one iota from their
claims upon a thoughtful people; yet it must be conceded
that their different subjects apply rather to the wants of
sections of the public than to the public in its integrity.
For instance, how few rejoice in the masculine exercise of
skittles! Toasted cheese, albeit the favourite diet of many
of Cyclopean digestion, is sedulously shunned by dyspeptic
hundreds of thousands. The class of the eel-skinning
public is indeed most limited; nutmeg is never dreamt of
by at least a million of our fellow-subjects; a million more,
it is our cheerful hope, know not the visitation of corns;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>whilst, could a census be taken of the number of kittens
annually sacrificed by drowning, it would possibly be
discovered that not one British subject out of five hundred
is ever called upon to perform that painful, yet necessary
and most domestic operation. It must then be acknowledged
that all handbooks hitherto published are more or
less limited in their application; but for “The Handbook
of Swindling,”—why, it is a national work; a <i>vade mecum</i>
for a whole people!</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the intention of the editor to dedicate this work to
some illustrious individual worthy of the distinction. But
so many candidates—all equally deserving of the honour—with
claims so nicely balanced, rose before him, that the
editor, considering it would be invidious to many to select
one alone, dedicates the book to the nation at large. Yes,
he gives it to his country; but too well repaid if he shall
be the means of calling from the working day road of life
one simple traveller to the pleasant “primrose path” made
easier and laid more open to him by this golden volume.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='sc'>the reader is introduced to Captain Whitefeather’s relations</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a favourite conviction of my late respected uncle
and godfather, Barabbas Whitefeather—he fell in the very
flower of his age, at only forty-five, a premature victim to
the insalubrity of Bermuda, where he was stationed in a
very public capacity by the British Government—it was,
I say, a pet belief of the sagacious Barabbas that every
man had within him what I think heathen philosophers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>have called a particle of divine gold; but which my uncle,
in the fine simplicity of his nature, and at the same time
humanely accommodating his language to the lowest understanding
of his species, denominated “a bit of the swindler.”</p>
<p class='c010'>Discriminating reader, Barabbas Whitefeather was a man
of homespun wit, who chewed not his words until they had
lost all their original form and vigour; no, he flung them
from him with the air of a man who knows he is laying
down a guinea of the best mint gold, and not timidly and
sneakingly, like a passer of gilt copper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Every man has within him a bit of the swindler!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The sentence fell upon me in the days of my earliest
childhood; yes, it was in that ductile, happy, and susceptible
season of life that the words of my uncle Barabbas—precious
seed!—dropped into my infant heart, where—but
let me not boast, let me rather indulge in the luxury of
memory—yes, suffer me, complying reader, to carry you
into the presence of my sainted uncle: bear with me whilst
with affectionate reverence I call up from the abyss of time
the interesting shadow of Barabbas Whitefeather.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was my birthday—I was six years old. I had been
promised that that day should be distinguished by a circumstance
which, as we advance in life and become involved
in the meshes of the world, is apt to be forgotten, albeit of
the first importance at the time—I was to be breeched.
<i>I was not.</i> I can only remember that a cloud seemed
suddenly to have fallen upon our house—that my father
would come home long after the lamb had lain down to
rest, and would still leave the domestic roof before the
rising of the lark, that his temper, generally rough, became
much rougher; and that, only a few days before my birthday,
on expressing my infantine delights at the trumpets
blown before the newly-arrived judges, he rebuked me
with unwonted emphasis, at the same time wishing the
trumpets and the judges, as I then conceived, very oddly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>incorporated with one another. I was then within a few
days of six years old—I was a fine, tall, plump child, and
on my birthday was to have been breeched. The neighbourhood
called for it. I repeat it, my birthday came and
passed, and found and left me still in coats.</p>

<p class='c010'>That day, however, was ordained to be the most eventful
of my life. It is that day which, if the world shall
continue to remember the deeds of Captain Barabbas
Whitefeather, must be held by posterity in especial respect.
It is to that day that I owe everything; and what I owe,
it would be the worst of affectation in the world to deny
or to forget. To proceed with my history.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Brab,”—it was thus my father was wont to tamper
with the euphony of Barabbas,—“Brab, nunkey wants to
see you; so you must toddle with me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Some weeks had elapsed since I had seen uncle
Barabbas; and at his name visions of cakes and apples,
peg-tops and whipping-tops, rose before me. Like
Agesilaus, Socrates, Yorick, and other men whom I do
not hesitate to call of his kidney, my uncle would chequer
and ameliorate the labour of public life by sporting with
little children. “He hath borne me on his back a thousand
times.” I was of course delighted at the prospect of
visiting my uncle; but was at the same time made to wonder
at the preparation of my father, who carefully bound up
one of his eyes, glued large whiskers on his cheeks, and
otherwise so disguised himself that, although I saw him do
it, I could scarcely believe it was he. However, I thought
it was all to have some game with Uncle Barabbas—and in
my childishness crowed with laughter at anticipation of the
sport.</p>

<p class='c010'>I walked with my father, and in about half-an-hour came
to a very large house, a place I had never seen before: for
my dear mother, always fuming about fevers and measles,
kept me close at home. My father, suddenly walking very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>lame, knocked at the door, and through a cold that had
come on him all in a minute, asked hoarsely enough for my
uncle. The man let us in, and then another man went
before us; and then I knew I was in a place where there
were heaps of gold and diamonds, for the man unlocked
and locked again at least a dozen doors. I give my
childish impressions, which I entreat the reader not to
smile at, but to remember the simplicity and ingenuousness
of my age. Well, after a time, we were led into an open
court, where some gentlemen were throwing up halfpence,
and two on a bench were pushing straws; and there was
one dancing, and one or two singing, and all as happy as
birds.</p>

<p class='c010'>I looked round the place and saw uncle Barabbas smoking
in a corner. I was about to call him when my father gave
my arm such a pull I thought it was broken; and so I
resolved to say nothing, but to wait and see the fun that
father would play off upon uncle. Sure enough Barabbas
never knew him; and though my uncle patted me upon the
head, he had, I thought, forgotten me, for he gave me
nothing. My father and my uncle talked together for a
long time; when—I see my uncle now—Barabbas suddenly
brought himself up, and raising his head, and extending his
right arm, the palm open, he said in a solemn voice:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Depend upon it, every man has within him a bit of the
swindler.”</p>

<p class='c010'>My father shook his head; whereupon my uncle, for he
was very scholarly, and could talk for an hour without
stopping, proceeded as follows:—I am perfectly certain as
to the words, having subsequently found the whole written
speech among other of my uncle’s papers; Barabbas, like
some other wits and orators, carefully putting in pen and
ink any brilliant thought that struck him—any argument
that was a hobby with him, that he might at proper season
extemporaneously bring it forth to the delight and astonishment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>of his hearers. My father shook his head at the
dogma of my uncle, who, without stop, continued:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you so ignorant as to believe in the deficiency
of mankind in general—to imagine that nature is so partial
a mother as to dower with her best gifts only a few of her
children, leaving the multitude defenceless, unarmed? My
dear sir,”—here my uncle lowered his voice,—“amend
your ignorance—be just to nature. Do you see tigers
whelped without claws—elephants calved that never have
tusks—rattlesnakes hatched with no stings? Is nature so
niggard—so partial—so unjust? No—philosophers and
conquerors have made their marks, and signed their names
to the fact—to swindle is to exhibit the peculiar attribute
of the human animal; it is at once the triumph and distinguishing
faculty of the race. But you will say, do all
men swindle? and I ask, do all snakes sting—all elephants
gore? There is, however, an unanswerable argument which
proves that men, when gregarious, are inevitably swindlers;
at least, if they are not, let not the failing be placed to their
account; they would be, if they might. Let me put a
case. You recollect Gloss, the retired merchant?
What an excellent man was Gloss! A pattern man
to make a whole generation by! Nobody could surpass
him in what is called honesty, rectitude, moral propriety,
and other gibberish. Well, Gloss joins a ‘Board’; he
becomes one of a community; and, immediately, the
latent feeling asserts itself: he is a backbone man with the
rest of his brotherhood; and though as simple Gloss, and
not a member of the ‘board,’ he is the same as ever, yet
when acting with his fellows, when one of the body corporate,
when he merges the man Gloss in the board member,
the inherent faculty becomes active, and he gratifies the
instinct, or the refined reason, or whatever men agree to
call it—and complacently swindles with the rest. He
cannot do otherwise: human nature is tested by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>occasion; and if, under the circumstances, he refuse to
swindle, he ceases to be a man. Swindling, my dear sir”—and
here my uncle spoke in a tremulous voice, and my
father seemed touched by the emotion—“Swindling, my
dear sir, has indeed a far more comprehensive meaning
than that superficially awarded to it by, possibly, very
respectable people. Good soldiers may fight, pillage, and
violate under a banner, and yet, in truth, shall not be able
to read and interpret the legend emblazoned on it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I could perceive that my father did not perfectly understand
this. He, therefore, nodded assentingly, and my
uncle, with new animation, proceeded:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I reflect on the extensive and subtle operation of
the faculty—when I perceive that, in this our best possible
social state, it is, so to speak, the cement that keeps society
together; the bond of union; the very salt of human government—it
does, I confess it, irk me to find men ungraciously
deny its existence, putting off its triumphs upon other
motives, and depriving swindling of the glory of its deeds.
Strange perversion of human intellect—laughable contradiction
of moral purposes! Thus, the politician flutters at
the very breath of swindler; thus, the stockbroker struts
and swells, and lays his hand upon his waistcoat with a blank
look of wondering innocence at the slightest allusion to the
faculty that makes a man of him—to which he owes his
carriage and country house, his conservatories and his
pineries; and above all, the flattering hope of calling Lord
Giggleton son-in-law; his lordship being over head, and,
what is more, over ears in love with Arabella’s guineas.
And yet, such is the base, the black ingratitude of human
nature, that this man, this most adroit and lucky stockbroker,
starts even at the name of swindler! He indignantly denies
the slightest obligation to the higher faculty—the <i>mens
divinior</i> of the cabinet, the mart, and the counting-house.
Look at Sir Godfrey Measles, the illustrious pork contractor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>in whom our brave and magnanimous sailors confide
for dinners. Did he not in the most handsome way forfeit
a fine to his king and country for having failed to supply
swine’s flesh at so much per stone? And then, having paid
his fine like a patriot and a man,—did he not, having before
bought up all the pork to be had—did he not, with the
gushing feelings of a philanthropist, offer it at three times the
contract price? Now what was this? Men who veil their
meaning in allegory may say that Sir Godfrey Measles
‘drove his pigs to a fine market.’ For myself, I elevate
the homely phrase of pig-driver into the more ennobling
name of swindler. Others may say that Sir Godfrey only
traded—I stick to my belief; I say he swindled. More:
I reverence him for the act; my only deep regret is, that
he should have failed in an ingenuous gratitude, and denied
the action of the higher principle. I have long looked upon
the world, and, with sorrow, I say it, in nothing do the
generations of successful men show so much cold and callous
ingratitude as in their treatment of their guardian genius,
that prettiest of Pucks, that best of Robin Goodfellows, that
deftest of household fairies, hight Swindling!”</p>

<p class='c010'>My father cast his one eye towards his eloquent brother
with a look of speaking admiration; and, although there
was a pause, did not presume to make any rejoinder. My
uncle proceeded:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why number examples? Why attempt to prove
that which every man, if he would but consult the recesses
of his own bosom, must truly know? Ask all the professions;
demand of the lawyer, with yellow, studious cheek,
wherefore he should coin gold out of little strips of paper,
written over by youthful scribes at two or three shillings
per diem. Request him to give you the philosophy of
costs—the exquisite meaning of appearance and declaration,
and reply and rejoinder, and all the thousand terms invented
by the most cunning class of labourers, the overlookers at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>the building of Babel. Ask the sleek practitioner to what
he owes his fortune. To common-sense—to justice—to
the fair and rational barter of labour for shillings? If
he be a hypocrite—if he be resolved to clap in with the
world, and carry on a profitable duplicity, he will swell like
a bull-frog at the query, and, forgetful of his knuckles, will
strike his heart, answering with the big-mouthed ‘Yes!’
But if at the end of a long practice there should by miracle
remain in that attorney’s bosom a throb of truth, he will
blandly, yet significantly smile at the words—the counters
men play with—common-sense and justice, and magnanimously
and unblushingly declare his debt to—swindling!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it otherwise with the physician, who sells his guesses
for truth, and doubts and doubts a patient into the grave,
whilst his medicinal palm is open for the guinea? When
the apothecary vends cinnamon and peppermint water for
<i>elixir vitæ</i>, doth he practise a noble art? Yea; for, safely
and successfully, he—swindles.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When the tradesman—his housemaid at the time
perhaps in Bridewell for petty larceny committed on
the greasepot—when he, smiling across the counter at
his victim, puts off knowingly the poorest commodity at
the highest price, how stands he in relation to his
captive handmaid? Why, Rebecca has robbed, but the
tradesman has only driven his trade: the slut has for ever
and for ever lost her character, with it seven pounds <i>per
annum</i>, and, it may be, tea and sugar included—but for Mr
Jackson, her master, he has turned the profit penny; he has—but
all in the way of business—swindled.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is very true,” exclaimed my father with an oath, “it
is very true. When what is swindling isn’t swindling
according to law, it’s a fortune to a man; but when it’s
agin law, and found out——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The result I know,” cried my uncle, a slight tint of red
suffusing his manly cheek. “All mankind may be divided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>into two classes: the swindlers according to custom and
to law, and the swindlers according to the bent of their
natural genius.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“True agin,” cried my father, slapping his thigh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Still, the propensity,” said my uncle, “is universal:
men only want temptation. It is extraordinary how, like a
chain, the feeling runs from breast to breast. Jack Smasher
was one of the prettiest hands at coining; and more, he was
blessed with a wife born, I should say, with a genius for
passing bad money. She took a crown—one of her
husband’s base-begotten offspring—purchased with it three
pennyworth of rhubarb from a Quaker chemist, who—undone
man!—handed over four-and-ninepence change.
Aminadab Straightback was, even among his brethren,
the brightest child of truth. In due season Aminadab
detected the guileful crown, and in his own clear breast
resolved to destroy it. However, it remained by the
strangest accident in his till, and by an accident still
more extraordinary, was given in part of change for a
guinea to a gentleman a little the worse for liquor, who
on his way home to bed took the precaution of dropping
into Straightback’s for a box of—his own patent—anti-bacchic
pills. In the morning the vinous gentleman discovered
the pocket-piece, but as he had changed more
than one guinea, could not with certainty detect the giver
of the counterfeit. No matter. It remained loose with
other money in his pocket, and one day, to his own
surprise, he found he had passed it. He had taken a
journey, and it was very dark when, in the handsomest
manner, he fee’d the coachman. The poor man who
drove the Tally-ho did not realise more than £400 per
annum, and could not afford to lose five shillings; hence
Smasher’s crown became at a fitting opportunity the
property of a sand-blind old gentlewoman, who, her loss
discovered, lifted up her hands at the iniquity of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>world, and put aside the brassy wickedness. The good
old soul never missed a charity sermon. The Reverend
Mr Sulphurtongue made a sweet discourse in favour of
the conversion of the Jews, and the churchwardens condescended
to hold each a plate. To the great disgust
of the discoverers, a bad crown was detected amongst
the subscribed half-crowns and shillings. The beadle
was directed to destroy it. He intended to do so, but,
in pure forgetfulness, passed it one day for purl; the
landlady of the ‘George’ having, as she said ‘taken it,
was resolved not to lose it,’ and by some accident it was
given to a pedlar, who, after a walk of twenty miles, entered
an ale-house, took his supper of bread and cheese, went
to bed, rose, and proffered for his account Jack Smasher’s
pocket-piece. The pedlar was immediately given into the
hands of a constable, taken before a magistrate, and ordered
to be imprisoned and whipped as a passer of counterfeit
coin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“See what luck is!” cried my father; “it’s the Quaker
<i>what</i> should have lost the dollar.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He couldn’t do it; for though he was a most respectable
person, and lived and died with that character, he was
but a man. He had been swindled—the link of the chain
was touched, and it vibrated—you perceive, it vibrated?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again my father nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” exclaimed Barabbas Whitefeather, “I repeat it—the
sympathy is universal. All men can, do, or might,
swindle. Though with many the propensity be latent, it
surely exists, and needs but the happy moment to be
awakened into life. The proof is easy: take ten, twenty,
thirty men—creatures of light; admirable, estimable,
conscientious persons; by-words of excellence, proverbs
of truth in their individual dealings; and yet, make of
them a ‘board’—a ‘committee’—a ‘council’—a ‘company’—no
matter what may be the collective name by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>which they may be known—and immediately every member
will acknowledge the quickening of a feeling—a sudden
growth of an indomitable lust to—swindle. What is
this but a proof of the faculty—as I have said—dormant,
but requiring only the necessary agent to awaken it?
Oh! let no man perk himself up in the pride of his
innocence—strut and pout, big with the prejudice of
respectability! He knows not the mystery of his own
nature; for though to his own eyes he shall be a saint,
he will, when time and purpose shall see fit to call his better
feelings into life, he will, he must, he cannot do otherwise
than—swindle.”</p>

<p class='c010'>My father, though a strong man, was much affected.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As for you, my dear child,” said my uncle, taking me
by the hand, kissing me, and looking benevolently upon
me, “as for you, remember the words of Barabbas Whitefeather.
At present you know not their worth, but a
time will come when better than pearls or gold will be
this my parting council to you. Throughout your life
do nought but swindle. If you can, swindle on the
right side of the statute, but at all events, my dear child,”—even
now I feel the pressure of that wise man’s lip,
the warm tear trickling down my cheeks,—“at all events,
Barabbas, swindle!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I am now in my nine-and-thirtieth year; and from
my first day of discretion until this, the season of ripest
manhood, I can, laying my hand upon my heart, most
conscientiously declare that never for a moment have I
forgotten the last injunction of the best of uncles. But
why should I speak on this head? The world will do me
justice.</p>

<p class='c010'>My uncle shook my parent by the hand. “Good-bye,”
he said; “we may never meet again, for I am now two-and-forty,
and you know”—this I could <i>not</i> understand—“you
know <i>it’s fourteen penn’orth</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>My father, choking with emotion, cried, “D—n ’em!”
We quitted my uncle; and I trust I shall not be accused
of adopting the language of hyperbole, when I state that we
quitted him with feelings far more easy of conception than
description.</p>

<p class='c010'>Only a twelvemonth after this, I lost my excellent father.
It may prove to the giddy and the vain the uncertainty of
life, when I state that my worthy parent was in robust
health one minute and dead the next. It may also prove
that he had held some place in the world, when I assure
the reader that crowds of people flocked to our house to
pay honour to his cold remains; which, for the benefit of
his widow and son, were exhibited at sixpence a head to
grown persons, and half-price for children. I should be
unjust to my parent’s memory were I to withhold another
circumstance illustrative of the consequence of my father to
the world at large: the night-cap in which he died was
purchased by a gentleman, a lover of the fine arts, after a
severe contest with other bidders, for two guineas.</p>

<p class='c010'>And so much for my uncle and my father, both worthy
of the name of Whitefeather.</p>

    <div>CAPTAIN WHITEFEATHER TAKES AN ENLARGED VIEW OF SWINDLING. SOCIAL EVILS AND THEIR REMEDY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>No</span>—the theme is too pregnant with circumstance; too
vast—too voluminous. Let me then subdue the vain,
though laudable, ambition—let me repress the fond, the
wild desire of such distinction. Is it for a single pen to
write the History of Swindling? Is it for one man to
chronicle, with scrupulous fidelity, the rise and progress of
the exquisite art (for I must call it so)? Is it for one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>curious pair of eyes—one toilsome hand—to pore over and
put down the many million facts to be registered in a complete
body of the Science? Could the life of a patriarch,
even though he worked the hours of a cotton-spinner,
suffice for the labour? Consider, Barabbas, what running
to and fro—what fetching and carrying of truths—what
sifting and winnowing of chaff and husk—what gold-washing—what
pearl-diving! Now picking up stray matter
for your work in Egypt—now, with a thought, among the
sages in India—now off, it may be, upon a wild-goose
chase to Arabia Petræa—now among the Scandinavians—and
now, cold as a snowball, to be called away to the
opium-sellers at the walls of the Tartars! Is it possible for
one man, though with ribs of brass and soles of adamant,
to go through the toil and travel? And this, be it remarked,
will only take in the first thousand years or so of the
age of our dear, ill-used mother earth. How much remains
to be done—what crooked ways to thread—what dirt and
rust to scratch away—what inscriptions to guess at—what
monuments to measure—even before you come to Semiramis!
And when, reeling like a porter under a thousand-weight of
facts—for a very few facts make a pound—you arrive at
Semiramis, have you disciplined yourself to bear the
indifference of a superficial generation—to be asked
by listless ignorance, “Who the devil is Semiramis?”
Dear Barabbas, your yearnings are indeed most noble;
but there is a limit to human action—there is a point
where man must stop. The task is not earthly; or, if
indeed it be a mortal labour, it is only to be achieved by the
united heads and hands of many. A band of hard-working
encyclopædists—temperate labourers living upon bread and
water and figs—might possibly, in the course of a few
lustres, produce some hundred volumes of the work; but a
complete body of swindling from the birth of time to its
present lustihood, it is a thing only to be dreamed of—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>glorious phantasm—a magnificent but most deceitful
vision!</p>
<p class='c010'>But grant it done. Say that the last proof—the ten
millionth sheet—lies before you, the smooth-faced devil
waiting at your garret door to carry off the corrected matter
for the press. Say that it is printed, published, and the
whole five hundred volumes folio scrupulously conned, as
they doubtless would be, by the critics—alack! alack!—what
a melancholy book hath the press groaned with—what
a ghastly chronicle, what a blood-dyed, tear-stained
record!</p>

<p class='c010'>“A complete body of swindling!” Let us turn a few of
the leaves. They creak like dungeon hinges! Are not
the pictures terrible? Whole generations of men, thin-chapped,
hollow-eyed, scourged and in bonds; fainting in
midday; stark with the dews of night. Tens of thousands,
living carcasses, in mines—thousands and thousands writhing
in blood and agony upon the field—with the vassals of
glory, a cloud of vultures, hovering to pick their bones.
Next let us peep through prison bars, and—no; close the
book—it is too shocking—one’s marrow freezes, and the
brain reels at it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Methinks,” says the reader, “the Captain takes a too
comprehensive view of his subject.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Right, sagacious reader; and yet, were the history of
swindling in all its ramifications to be duly chronicled, the
work would be no less voluminous, no jot less tragical.
The present is, after all, not an auspicious age for folios;
neither is it the best of all possible eras for the publication
of disagreeable truths. Lazarus himself, to touch worldly
sympathy, should in these days be a Lazarus in superfine
cloth—the best cambric and the glossiest beaver; nay, he
would be something the gainer by a waistcoat of gold-smeared
velvet, and, at least, a chain of silver. To make
iniquity or sorrow bearable, it is highly necessary that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>should be properly dressed. Hence, reader, I, Barabbas
Whitefeather, instructed by the better spirit of the age,
forego my first Utopian purpose, and leaving the full history
of swindling to be written by a future college of sages, shall
confine myself more immediately to the existing wants of
the world—shall attend to the crying necessities of the
present generation. Controlled by my better genius, I
renounce folios.</p>

<p class='c010'>After all, the world has not, as I at first superficially
believed, so keen a want of a complete history of swindling:
for how many books have been written which,
although not professedly treating of the theme, are, by their
very subject, works of reference and authority in the matter!
What, for instance, is much of <i>Ancient History</i>? What
<i>The Lives of the Roman Emperors</i>? What <i>The History of
Conquests</i>? What <i>The History of Discovery</i>—from the
first finding of Mesopotamia to the last providential flight
upon New Zealand? If men will read not with their eyes
alone, but with understanding hearts, how much is there in
all these works, in all these narratives, that is indeed no
other than materials for a complete body of swindling?
Loose pearls that need stringing—scattered lights to be
brought to one point? Indeed, to a contemplative mind,
to a reader properly prepared for the perusal of history
and biography, it is almost impossible for him to open a
volume from which he should not gather knowledge of a
swindling kind. It is often the very staple of a book,
though to the shame of many writers, I grieve to say it,
the subject is most ungenerously disguised under foreign
trappings—passed off under a false name. Hence, reflecting
that if men will look round them, they are not wholly
destitute of works containing the philosophy of swindling on
a grand historical scale—on an enlarged and transcendental
plan—I shall endeavour to prevail upon myself to become
merely useful, leaving it to the poorly ambitious to glitter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>and to soar. Let other men make pedestals to themselves
of unopened folios; they have their veneration—they are
talked of, never read. I—I will descend among the crowd—will
mix with my fellow-creatures—will right and left
scatter among the children of innocence a “Handbook”—a
veritable tome to be carried between the thumbs and
fingers of men in their paths by day, and like a guardian
and protecting genius to nestle in their bosoms at night.
Yes, it shall be no large carcass of a book; no literary
mammoth of a bygone time; a load for a shelf; but a light
and dainty fairy for the palm. A “Handbook!”—Yes,
there is a freshness, a beauty, a truthfulness in the name;
it shall be “<span class='sc'>The Handbook of Swindling</span>!” Uncut
folios, avaunt! and, thick as humming-birds in tropic
groves, “Handbooks,” in green and gold, trim your glowing
winglets and flutter among men.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c017'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f11'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The reader will perceive from the self-complacency with
which the author talks of “Handbook,” that he would pass
the compound as purely one of his own invention. The editor,
however, conceives it to be a part of his stern duty to state that
a book printed at Baden-Baden, where the Captain was wont to
retire in autumn for the benefit of the waters and other benefits—a
book entitled (we give the English) “The Handbook of
Cogging,” was found among the Captain’s other literary effects.
He had, doubtless, forgotten that Handbook was from <i>Handbuch</i>.—[<span class='sc'>John
Jackdaw</span>, Ed.]</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Having resolved upon the mode in which I shall benefit
humanity, having come to the determination to contract
myself into the smallest possible size, that I may the more
deftly make my way among the crowd, it is but due to myself—it
is but just to my readers—to make known in a few
words the extent and range of my purpose. That purpose
is, I am proud to feel it, of the best wisdom, of the noblest
benevolence; it is to make every man—at least every thinking,
reasonable man, for I write not to blockheads—a
<span class='sc'>Swindler</span>. Yes; it is my aim to render him, at all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>points, armed for the contest of life—to prepare him for
the cutting and thrusting and picking and stealing of this
eventful passage. It is my purpose to make known a few
golden rules—the result of a long and various experience—by
which the attentive and quick-witted student may learn
to play with men as he would play with pieces of chess, by
which every move on the board of life may be his own, to
the utter discomfiture of a plodding and merely painstaking
opponent. And in all this there shall be nothing legally
forbidden; nothing that shall suddenly shock your delicate
nostrils, reader, with the smell of hemp: no, no; though
turnkeys and the hangman walk about you, if you are an
apt scholar, you shall snap your fingers at them, and swindle
securely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And now,” thinks the reader,—for I know his thoughts
as well as I know my own whiskers,—“now the book begins
to open; now the work warms up.” Be not impatient.</p>

<p class='c010'>Impressed as I am with the purpose of this inestimable
little work, it befits the dignity of that purpose that there
should be no unseemly haste, no helter-skelter in the communication
of ideas. Were I writing the “<span class='sc'>Handbook of
Egg-Sucking</span>,” or any such domestic treatise, I might jump
into my subject; but “<span class='sc'>Swindling</span>” is not to be approached
irreverently.</p>

<p class='c010'>Its influence on the happiness of society is to be duly
considered, that the maxims by which it is the hope of the
author to recommend it may have their due weight upon
the disciple; who, when he shall learn that swindling is,
indeed, synonymous with self-preservation, will brush up
his hair, take breath, and then, unless he have no more
sensibility than a stock or stone, lapse into a state of the
profoundest and most admiring attention. Yes; I was right—the
pupil is now all ears.</p>

<p class='c010'>Philanthropists and philosophers have come to the comfortable
conclusion that there are in England too many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Englishmen. John Bull has played the Sultan, and has
an alarmingly numerous family. Unhappily, however, he
has not the Sultan’s wealth—neither has he the Sultan’s
prerogative: he cannot feed all his sons and daughters; he
must not choke or drown them. The bow-string and the
Bosphorus are not for John. What then is to become of
the family of Bull? Shall they tear each other piecemeal?
Forgetful of their origin, shall they destroy one another in
civil fight? <i>Amor patriæ</i>—humanity—all the finer and
nobler feelings of the human heart revolt at the very
thought. “What,” the philanthropist will inquire with
tears in his eyes—“what, then, is to be done with a
superabundant population?” My reply is as brief as, I
flatter myself, it is conclusive—they must swindle. We
have been gradually adopting what I believe to be the only
remedy for the national disease; we have for some years
in many instances applied what I conceive to be the only
cure for the social malady; but it is only when it shall be
applied upon a grand scale, when, in fact, a curative science
shall be professed and practised by men cognisant of all its
subtle and most bountiful capabilities—for it is yet in its
infancy—that the greatness of its social value will be
thoroughly manifested and acknowledged.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is allowed that all the professions are full to running
over. The Church is crammed to suffocation with applicants
for deaneries, prebends, vicarages; to say nothing of
the thousands with their hearts fixed upon mitres. There
is hardly standing room among the candidates for lawn and
silk aprons.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Courts of Law there are wigs as thick as cauliflowers
in Battersea Gardens. Besides, the sneaking spirit
of the times has so enervated the British character, that
Englishmen lack somewhat of that generous pugnacity
which, in the days of our fathers, would precipitate them
into the arena of the law to feed with their own flesh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>the lions therein prowling. And when it happens that a
gentleman with the true English blood in him shall resolve
upon such noble sacrifice, why, so numerous are the
animals awaiting him, that many a term shall pass, and
not one of the <i>carnivora</i> shall have so much as a mouthful
of the honest gentleman’s flesh—shall not even make their
mark in him. Consider it well, reader; count, if you can,
the hundreds of excellent, watchful, well-disposed persons
who, every morning during term, come down to the Courts
to prey; and who, nevertheless, return to their homes all
innocent of strife. Is not this a discouraging prospect for
thousands of young men, most of them very willing to
become Chancellor? But so it is; the profession has a
greater supply than demand. In fifty years it will be
thought great luck in a man to die Lord Chief Justice or
Attorney-General.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Army, a profession that I have followed with
an ardour peculiarly my own, can anything be more
barren? Here am I, at the age of nine-and-thirty—I,
who have—but no, the dignity of my subject, the national
importance of this treatise, shall not be lessened or
neglected by aught personal. Hence, I disdain to speak
of a deep bayonet wound inflicted in the most dastardly
manner in the small of my back, during my first campaign
in Biscay—of a gash across my nose, from an enemy’s
sickle, when bivouacking in a hen-roost—of an imaginary
fracture of the <i>os</i>—but no; I have said it, I will not
mingle my private griefs, were I chicken-hearted enough
to think them so, with matters of national interest. Besides,
every man’s country is proverbially ungrateful to
him. Hence, I should despise myself did I more than
allude, in the most evanescent way, to my heavy pecuniary
losses in the service of Mexico, Chili, Peru, and other
places too numerous to mention. But so it is; and what,
I ask—what cares the commander-in-chief, sitting in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>pride of place at the Horse Guards—what cares he for my
superb plum-pudding spotted charger, shot whilst grazing—it
was only the day before I had been on him—by an
enemy’s vidette? What cares he for the loss of my three
saddles, generously given up to be converted into highlows
for my barefooted comrades? Yes, what—I must, I will
ask it—cares the said commander-in-chief for the subsequent
ignominy endured in consequence of that gallant
steed—that by me devoted leather? Would it affect him,
even for half-an-hour, to know that on my return to
England—my beloved land!—after three years’ absence, I
was, at half-past six on a December morning, summoned
by my landlady to see a Mr Jones, the said Mr Jones and a
friend at the same time entering my apartment to remind
me of my lost barb, my long-forgotten saddles? On that
morning the commander-in-chief was, I doubt it not, snoring
ingloriously in bed; little dreaming—it may be, little caring—that
at that hour a brother soldier, placed between two
big men in a small gig, was being conveyed at the rate of
three miles an hour through fog and frost to Chancery
Lane. I remember the Tyburn-like pace; for, let me do
his benevolence justice, Mr Levi in the handsomest way
apologised for not having had the horse <i>roughed</i>; adding
that, as he had no other call to make that morning, “he
was not in no ’urry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Friendly reader, as an officer and a gentleman, I protest
to you that I would not have even thus casually alluded to
personal adventures did they not in the most striking, and
I may add in the most pathetic manner illustrate the condition
of a man who, with a military flame burning in his
breast, generously offers his fire in the cause of nations. I
might proceed; but the same modesty that has hitherto
confined me to the rank of captain—and I may here allude
to an infamous conspiracy on the part of the publisher and
printers of the <i>Army List</i>, my name, as I have been informed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>having been maliciously omitted from that miscellany—the
same modesty ties up my tongue on my own
sufferings, my own deserts; or at most but lets it move in
fitful murmurings. I have done! To proceed.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Army what are the hopes for superabundant young
gentlemen, too spirited to starve, and too nice to dig?
What, I ask, can be their hopes when a hypocritic sentimentality
is gaining ground amongst those who are pleased
to call themselves thinking men—a whining, sneaking
abuse of glory and all its mighty purposes? There is a
whimpering, white-faced cowardice that would extract all the
stern immortal beauty from the battlefield, showing it to be
no other than a place of butchery; that would display the
valiant soldier with his throat cut, his bowels gloriously protruding,
as a horrible sight—a piece of sacrilege done by man
upon his fellow. And more than this, the same cant lifts up
its face of turnip pallor, and pointing to where ten or twelve
thousand stalwart fellows lie magnificently dead in blood
and mire, has the effrontery to ask <i>cui bono</i>, as my old schoolmaster
used to say—to put the impudent “<i>What’s the good
of it?</i>” I should abuse the ingenuousness of the young
martial spirit were I to be silent on the innovation of this
wicked principle; a principle which, with the infamous
invention of the steam gun and the unhallowed introduction
of the rocket brigade, will go far, or Captain Whitefeather
is no prophet, to utterly destroy what I was once proud to
think the instinct for war in the “paragon of animals.”
There is something inconceivably cowardly in the steam
gun. Possessed of such engines, neither party will fight;
and thus, nations always prepared for war, will hold continual
peace. They will, so to speak, treat and deliberate
at “full cock”; and being always ready, will never fire. Is
not this, I ask, a lamentable state of the world for a man to
be born in? Let us, however, unflinchingly look truth in
the face; by so doing we shall be the better prepared for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>the evil days at hand, which to enable men to meet with
some serenity of mind is the high purpose of this essay.
Such days are nearer, much nearer, than those who have
capital in powder mills like to dream of. We shall, of course,
continue to keep a small standing army; but blank cartridges
for birthdays will be the only order from the Horse
Guards: bullets will become as rare as brilliants; whole
tons of the death-dealing lead being sold to the type-founders.
Laurel, “the meed of mighty conquerors”—why
a whole grove of it will in the coming time be held of no
more account, nay, of not so much, as a handful of dried marjoram.
Have I dreamt it, or did I at a late philosophical
meeting see a grave, pragmatic man rise from his seat, and
when up, did I or did I not hear him seriously put it as a
motion—that the planet Mars should be no longer called
Mars, but be known to all future generations as <span class='sc'>James Watt</span>?</p>

<p class='c010'>The Army, then, affords no refuge for the tens of thousands
up to within these few years begotten, christened,
suckled, nursed, fondled, schooled, petted, sported with,
wept over by fathers and mothers, uncles and aunts, grandfathers
and grandmothers, for the glorious purposes of war.
In such case is it not, I ask, the highest purpose of the
philanthropist to find employment for men, who in happier
times might have been usefully employed in burning the
cottages of our enemies, lessening the numbers of our
enemies’ children (thus nipping a foe in the bud) on lances
and bayonets, tearing up olive groves, carrying away the
vanity of plate and pictures from enemies’ churches, and in
fire, and blood, and terror, planting the immortal bay? Since
the British Lion is no longer to be fed upon Frenchmen’s
flesh, since he is henceforth to have a regimen of bread
and milk and dates, it behoves us to see that he be gradually
and duly prepared for the change in his diet, lest consumption
fall upon him; or, a still greater point, lest he break
all bonds and spread dismay around.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>I have now, I trust, convincingly proved that the many
asylums hitherto open to the pious, the wise, and the brave,
are most inconveniently crammed; and that with less room
for an increasing generation, the crowds will consequently
become more dense, more clamorous, and in a word, more
revolutionary. What is the remedy in this great natural
crisis?</p>

<p class='c010'>In one word make I answer—“Swindling!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The philosophy of the present time is remarkable for its
contempt—nay, for its wholesome abhorrence of poverty.
A want of the luxuries of life is not merely inconvenient, it
is positively ignominious. Hence what wrigglings, and
smugglings, and heartburnings are every day acted and
endured, to stand well with the world; that is, to stand without
a hole in our hat or a damning rent in our small clothes!
The modern man is wonderfully spiritualised by this philosophy;
so much so that if he can secure to himself a
display of the collar he is almost wholly unconscious of the
absence of the shirt. Indeed so deep and so widely spread
is this sentiment that the present time might be denominated
the Age of Collars.</p>

<p class='c010'>This spirit is on the advance; and it is the consciousness
of this truth that impresses upon me the necessity of
publishing a system by the adoption of which the country
may be saved from a desolating revolution, and tens of
thousands of future generations be secured those benefits
and enjoyments which, as the sons of Adam, they are
justified in expecting from the fulness of time.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have proved, at least to my own satisfaction—a great
sustaining point with an author—proved that by the natural
course of things multitudes of generous spirits, before
devoted to the professions, will be thrown upon their own
resources—a dreadful condition for most men. What is
to become of them? They cannot sink down into petty
hucksters; railroads have destroyed the race of pedlars;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>they must not, even if they had sufficient moral courage,
hold forth their white hands as medicants; and if, stung
by the injustice of society, they should in a moment of
exasperation take to the road, why, highwaymen, save
and except the highwaymen of fifty years ago, cease to be
picturesque; and there is another heavy discouragement—the
barbarous institution of a rural police. These fiery souls—the
unemployed, superabundant young gentlemen—must,
then, become knight-errants; that is, they must institute an
order of chivalry peculiar to the age, and the best calculated
to meet the wants of the sufferers. Let us take a single knight.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here is Peter Muddleton, son of Jonah Muddleton,
greengrocer, Houndsditch. Jonah Muddleton dies, leaving
Peter heir to the goodwill of his shop, with seven hundred
pounds in the three per cents. Well, had Peter fallen upon
a less ambitious age, he would have tied his apron around
him, walked behind the counter, and, saving a new coat
of red and yellow paint bestowed upon the outside of the
shop, and the substitution of “Peter” for “Jonah,” things
would have gone on even as when Muddleton senior was
in the flesh. Peter, however, has a spirit above ha’porths
of starch and pen’orths of pepper; and having, as he most
potently believes, a gentlemanly taste, resolves to do anything
that may become a gentleman, but certainly not
keep to a shop. The seven hundred pounds, to Peter’s real
astonishment, become in a brief time about eight hundred
shillings. A little month and Peter is penniless. What
is to be done? Is Peter to be blamed for the spirit of the
age? Could he, the hapless son of a vulgar sire, stultify
himself to the fascinating and exalting appeals of an
advancing era? No; he is, in the first instance, the victim
of over refinement, and his moral perceptions having been
rendered painfully acute to the degradation of a shop, and
his physical man far too thin-skinned for the labour of
Adam—and, moreover, having not a sixpence, and seeing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>no gentlemanly mode of obtaining that much-abused yet
most necessary little coin—he magnanimously resolves to
eat and drink the best, and to wear the costliest, and all—without
it. This is the determination of a genius: but
even the most consummate wit may be assisted by the
experience of others, and it would be a sorry affectation in
me—it would be worse, it would be a gross injustice to my
fellow-creatures—to deny that from my own observation
of life I am incapable of the dearest services to young
gentlemen so curiously placed as Peter Muddleton.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have taken a single case; I have adduced one of the
humblest examples; I already see a hundred thousand,
many varying in their original rank in life; but all, at
length, compelled by the spirit of the age to take their
stand upon the broad ground of—<span class='sc'>Swindling</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>All commercial operations of the present, and certainly
of the future age, do and will tend to place the whole wealth
of the country in a few hands. I am not vain enough to
suppose that this book will enjoy a large daily sale for more
than a hundred years; with all the partiality of an author, I
cannot bring myself to expect that the state of society—whose
wants the work is to meet—will endure above another
century. However, I shall have done my duty, and I may
safely leave the year 2000 to the active philanthropy of
other <span class='sc'>Whitefeathers</span>. For more than the next hundred
years there must, if my previous hypotheses are allowed, be
an enormous amount of intelligence unemployed by the
professions; the tangible fat of the land becoming every
year engrossed by a smaller number. Now, to prevent any
violent partition of property, it is—I can lay my hand on
my heart and vow it—it is my purpose to make the few
contribute in the easiest and pleasantest way to the wants
of the many. Briefly, it is my object to show to the elegant
unemployed how they may successfully and safely swindle
the shopkeeping minority. The whole system is reduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>into a trial of wit; and if the swindler be a man of real
genius, and the man swindled have a touch of generous
feeling in him, he will forget what might be vulgarly called
a loss in admiration of his conqueror. I have seen much
of shopkeeping nature; and I am convinced that a man
properly, wholly, and withal delicately swindled—where there
have been no rubs or hitches in the work—that a man who,
with all his eyes and ears about him, has nevertheless,
without his knowing it, been turned, “like a cheveril glove,”
inside out by the professor—that such a man, after the first
burst of disappointment, feels but little of the bitterness of
resentment; the small drop of gall in his heart is speedily
taken up, and by a process delightful for the benevolent mind
to consider, is assimilated to the milk of human kindness
still running in the ventricles of the swindled; who—I
have known such an instance—after a moody, savage look,
will burst into a laugh, slap his leg, and with a confident,
yea, with an exulting voice, declare that “no less a swindler
could ever have swindled <i>him</i>.” Here is a homage—an
irresistible token of admiration—paid to one man; and if
we consider, in proportion to the possessions of the others,
how small, how trivial has been the tribute levied upon
him, a positive enjoyment afforded to another! Believe
it, reader, the swindled, if well swindled, is not without his
joy.</p>

<p class='c010'>This maxim is never to be lost sight of by the pupil. If
he would disarm a man of the natural ferocity of the animal
when fobbed, he must fob him blandly, graciously, completely.
Humanity—a consideration of the feelings of
others—demands this. How often have we seen a worthy
man in a very tempest of passion—his face like copper—his
eyes starting—his tongue stammering his wrongs:—“The—the—the—infamous
scoundrel!—the barefaced villain!
Did he think I was to be done in that way? Did he think
me a fool?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>There it is, take the good man’s goods; but, in the
taking, see you never wound his self-love.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p class='c027'>OF THE FACE NECESSARY TO A SWINDLER—(AN INCIDENTAL
SPECULATION ON THE “DIVISION OF PROPERTY”)—AND
OF THE USE AND ABUSE OF MUSTACHIOS</p>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>It</span> is a homely expression, often used in reply to a sarcasm
on a personal deformity, “that we did not make ourselves.”
Not even a Professor of Political Economy can
argue away this conviction, rooted as it is in the depths
of the human heart. Much, however, can be done with the
rude lump—if indeed it be rude—whereof man finds himself
the ill-starred possessor. Hence, let no one moderately
deformed despair of his fitness to join our brotherhood
Hump backs, club feet, and bow shins have, it must
be owned, their disadvantages for the service—notwithstanding,
the genius of their owners may triumph over such
outward obstacles. A fine face tastefully set in hair may
be considered a blessing for the profession; yet it would be
to inflict a great injustice on the higher uses of the science
to suppose a mere face so framed all-sufficient. No; “we
work by wit and not by whiskers.” The outward man goes
far, but he must depend upon the ethereal spark—upon the
inward intelligence—for self-distinction.</p>
<p class='c010'>And first for the <span class='sc'>Face of a Swindler</span>. Men who set
themselves up as judges of character—I have heard the
sciolists—sometimes marvel that the sons of commerce
should so frequently fall victims to some individual swindler;
when he, the party swindling, is one of the most ingenuous
creatures breathing; looking, in fact, the swindler that he
is,—when from his eyebrows to the corners of his lips there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>is painted in the largest human capitals the calling of the
professor. The truth is, the unsuspecting men accustomed
to pore over day-books and ledgers have not had sufficient
time to learn to read human faces. They can on the
instant, if put to the test, tell a good guinea from a bad
one; but though they shall stare in the features of a
human counterfeit for an hour or more, they cannot, one in
a hundred, discover the washed brass from the true gold.
More; though they shall hear the counterfeit—though the
ring of its voice shall be the truest Brummagem—the
trading man shall complacently rub his hands, satisfied that
he is hearing the sweetest sound of the mint.</p>

<p class='c010'>I confess it, to the honour of the trading community of
this commercial country, I confess it; the success of some
faces of my brotherhood upon men behind counters has
been to me startling evidence of the unsophisticated
character of the tradesman. For instance; there is
Nobrowns, Scarceamag, Fleeceington, and others I could
name—shall I own it?—I have sometimes felt myself
humiliated by their prosperity. I have felt the science
lowered by the facility with which they have ingratiated
themselves into the favour of the jeweller, the coachmaker,
the tailor. Had <i>I</i> kept shop, I have thought I should
have shown Nobrowns to the door at the first glance of his
eye; and without looking at Scarceamag, but simply hearing
his base-metal voice, I should have told him I had nothing
in his way, and straightway ordered him across the threshold.
And yet these men have flourished for a score of
years; and, at this moment, are prosperous swindlers. How
is the enigma to be explained—how the more than Arcadian
innocency of the dwellers in Bond Street and Regent
Street to be philosophically accounted for? Is it, that
men immersed in the profound abstraction of £ s. d.
lose somewhat of the sagacity inherited and often improved
by poorer souls; that, too much rapt by the splendid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>visions of the future profits, they are less vigilant as to
the danger of present credit? Providence, however, hath
wisely partitioned its benefits. If it be given to Scarceamag,
with <i>his</i> face, to swindle and be poor—it is also
allotted to Puddingtête, the tradesman, to be swindled
and grow rich. Take this, then, my dear pupil, for an
axiom: you may—since you cannot help it—look the
greatest swindler in life; but if you shall hold your own
counsel, your face shall, at least to the acute men behind
counters, never reveal it. Tradesmen can read anything
but customers’ faces.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c017'><sup>[12]</sup></a> This truth is every day borne out
by the success of fellows whose features have gone far to
vulgarise the science. Ragamuffins who ought never to have
aspired beyond the pea-and-thimble board at a country fair—knaves
marked and impressed by the truthful hand of
nature for the lowest offices of legerdemain have, trusting to
the simplicity, the unsuspecting ingenuousness of a money-getting
generation, to the marvellous innocency of the commercial
body, made for themselves a reputation of the
first class, or of very nearly the first class of the highest
profession. Ultimately, in the advancement of society, these
vulgar upstarts will be met by a greater number of competitors,
elevated and accomplished with the graces of life,
and the term swindler will be, as it ought to be, synonymous
with gentleman. The commercial faculty will, on the other
hand, be rendered more acute in its observation of human
character; hence it will require a greater delicacy of style—more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>imposing and a more winning manner to arrive at
any distinction—indeed, even to make a clear paltry five
hundred a year as a swindler, than in these times will suffice
to ensure to a tolerably industrious man an income of a
thousand. This is inevitable. When the tens of thousands
of noble spirits, heretofore absorbed by the professions, are
left to trade upon their wits—when all society is more
strongly marked, more arbitrarily divided into two classes,
the swindlers and the swindled—when, instead of a violent
and ruthless division of property, as infamously as ignorantly
insisted upon by certain firebrands—there is a graceful
exchange of elegant patronage on the one side, and a profound
expression of thanksgiving respect on the other, the
character of the successful swindler will rise to its ordained
and natural elevation, and a Whitefeather (pardon the
honest vanity) take his place with many illustrious names
sufficiently obvious to the philosophical reader. The time
is happily passing away when brute violence is to achieve
national good—when the price of bread is to be beaten
down by a bludgeon, or wages raised upon a pike. It is
therefore a matter of deep regret to the contemplative man,
and such I am not ashamed to confess myself, to perceive
how many gifted persons are, by a premature nativity, ill-placed.
How many men at the present day breathing
national arson and patriotic pillage—men who have so
profoundly studied the <i>meum</i>, that they are entirely ignorant
of that of <i>tuum</i>—would, born a few years hence, have shed a
lustre, have conferred a dignity upon even an illustrious and
dignified profession. Let me not be asked to enumerate
examples—I eschew the personal for the general. It is
enough that the eye of the philosopher can perceive in
many a sulphureous patriot the indefatigable swindler; that
the sage, pondering on the inevitable changes of society,
can detect in a present Bull-ring Brutus all the misapplied
qualities of a future Isaac Solomons!</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f12'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r12'>12</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I can scarcely believe that Captain Whitefeather was a reader
of the Essays of David Hume; and yet a similar opinion—a friend
of mine, a poor curate to whom I showed the Captain’s MS.,
pointed it out to me—is expressed by the sceptic philosopher, who,
in his Essay on “Delicacy of Taste,” says:—“You will seldom
find that mere men of the world, whatever strong sense they may
be endowed with, are very nice in distinguishing characters, or in
marking those insensible differences and gradations which make
one man preferable to another.”—[<span class='sc'>John Jackdaw</span>, Ed.]</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Blissful time—glorious return of the golden age—when
rapine and fire, and cutting and maiming shall no longer be
the evils adopted by comprehensive minds to work out, as
they conceive, a great good; but when one half of the people
shall live peaceably upon the other; when the whole aim and
end of every two men out of four shall be to possess themselves
of their daily bread—(philosophers will receive the
phrase in its more enlarged meaning)—by an art demanding
in its exercise the highest and most chastened faculties of the
moral creature. The two halves of society will then be fairly
arrayed against each other; and for ruthless weapons—for
sword, dagger, and pistol on one side, and bayonet, sabre,
and carbine on the other—we shall have the more peaceful
and courteous instruments, silvery words, blandest smiles,
and the happiest self-possession, opposed by cautious interrogation,
wary looks and silent heavy doubtings. Here
then is a contest worthy of intellectual beings! This is
indeed a duello of the immortal principle! How poor,
how savage, how unworthy of a rational creature to break
into the peaceful dwelling of an honest silversmith—to fire
his bed-curtains—to bruise and batter his ornate cream-jugs,
his chased candlesticks, and embossed tankards,—or, the
spoil carried off amidst the exulting howl of barbarians, to
fling it into the hospitable melting-pot—how loathsome,
how degrading this brutal mode of a division of property, to
that refined and gracious system, the cunning birth of better
times—the fruit of a loftier and truer consideration of man’s
dignity towards his fellow!</p>

<p class='c010'>Let us consider the two pictures; let us contemplate the
working of the different principles. How revolting the
scene of violence! How debasing to our common nature
to witness a mob of denaturalised creatures bursting in the
good man’s door! How they scamper upstairs! Like
festal savages they wave firebrands and torches about their
heads as they rush into the sacred bedroom. The worthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>man says a short prayer, and thinks of his stock—his wife
and daughters, trembling for their lives, are horrified at
being seen in nightcaps with their hair in paper! All the
house is in consternation; and, a touch of humanity softening
the mob, they benevolently suffer the silversmith and
his family to escape, in their night-clothes, over the roof,
and descend, like cats, into the gutter of their neighbour.
The shop is ransacked of everything; and now a sanguinary
fight is going on behind the counter between two of the
ruffians for the plated top of a pepper-castor. This—this
is one principle of a division of property; as if property
was only to be divided by the blaze of torches and the
crackling of rafters! Turn we to the ennobling contrast.</p>

<p>“Politely receives his destroyer”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c009'>Mark the swindler! How graciously he descends from
his chariot—for the swindler of first-rate genius rarely
marauds on foot—and with what a composed elegance, with
what a perfect self-possession he enters the shop! There
is something inexpressibly taking in his manner. Surveying
him from head to foot, we cannot repress the opinion that
the “age of chivalry” is <i>not</i> past. He is the knight of
later times—the Chevalier Bayard in a round hat. <i>Sans
peur</i> glows in his eyeball, and the whiteness of his kid
gloves is <i>sans reproche</i>! Two or three centuries ago he
had, with mailed hand, “shaken the bags of hoarding
abbots,” and now comes he, with a condescending smile at
his mouth, to deal with a silversmith. See! he crosses
the threshold—treads the shop. It is impossible to resist
the fascination of his lofty courtesy. The tradesman, wary
as he is—suspicious as loss after loss has made him—despite
of himself, confesses the supremacy of the stranger, and,
with a smiling lip, a twinkling eye, folded palms, and
inclined back, politely receives his destroyer. A conversation
ensues; and the swindler—I am of course putting the
case of a man of genius—fastens upon the tradesman, who
every moment becomes more deeply impressed with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>consequence of his patron; and therefore, having flung to
the winds all low suspicion, is the most obsequious, the most
humble servant of the swindler. There is nothing too
costly for him—nothing too curious; no order too difficult
to be met—no time too short for the accomplishment of
his wishes. The swindler is evidently a man of the very
highest consequence; and the silversmith, if I may adopt a
homely expression, is inevitably <i>done</i>, ay, done—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The swindler whirls away from the tradesman, who has
attended him, bareheaded, to the kerbstone, and then the
man of precious metals returns to his shop in that delightful
serenity of mind, apt, I am told, to possess people with
profits ranging from fifty to seventy-five in the hundred.</p>

<p class='c010'>What—it will be asked—what, does Mr Giltspur, the
silversmith, without further questions put, trust his service
of plate, besides a magnificent suite of amethysts (for which
the honourable Mr Thug expressed a sudden liking), to
the honour of his customer? To be sure he does; and his
blood simmering with a sense of profit, he orders them to be
delivered at “——— Hotel,” where Mr Thug is staying;
but which delightful and convenient hostelry he, shortly
afterwards, suddenly leaves on the most imperative business.
A thousand instances bear out the probability of Thug’s
success and Giltspur’s discomfiture. People may talk about
the innocence of a pastoral age: I am, from long experience,
convinced of it, that the most innocent, the most unsuspecting,
the most easily-taken biped on the face of the earth is—your
London shopkeeper. Armed with proper weapons,
it is almost impossible that he can escape you. The poor
creature is weakness, imbecility itself; “Wear your eye
thus,” and as surely as the fluttering bird drops into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>mouth of the snake, as surely fall the tribe of Giltspurs into
the folds of the Thugs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Well, and is it not delightful that it should be so? Here
is Giltspur, for a certain number of days at least, made very
happy; he has delivered his goods, and has already calculated
to the odd sevenpence-halfpenny the amount of
profit. Thug has conferred upon him a great pleasure—passing,
it must be owned—but sweet, very sweet, whilst it
endures.</p>

<p class='c010'>Does the reader still remember the picture of violence
drawn in a former page? Does he still behold the pallid
silversmith—his fainting wife—and blushing daughters?
Does he yet hear the roar of the flames, as they come up
the staircase—the fury of pillage in the shop below?</p>

<p class='c010'>The same effect is produced by the swindler, but how
different the cause! The “division of property” is just
as complete—the fine, deep philosophy that preaches it
equally well honoured; and yet, what grace on one side—what
civility on the other; and, to one party at least, what
tangible, enduring satisfaction! Who, then, with the
smallest spark of human dignity within him would stoop
to violence when he may “divide” with ease? The
“multiplication” of the human animal is, indeed, according
to the modern school-men, “vexation”; but the “division”
of property—unless divided on the bland principles of swindling—would
be infinitely worse. In the progress of society,
then, it is by swindling, and by swindling only, that we shall
escape the most grievous revolution.</p>

<p class='c010'>To proceed with the personal qualifications necessary to
a Swindler. He must have a face of purest brass. If
handsome, all the better; yet, perhaps, expression is of
greater importance than the mere proportion of feature.
If, however, he <i>look</i> a Swindler—if to the contemplative
men who peruse human lines, printed in the blackest ink on
some human faces, he look his profession—his success with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>the sages of trade is certain. It is, however, of the first
importance that there should be no alloy in the face. It
should, for instance, be as incapable of emotion as the bull
hide on the shield of Ajax.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c017'><sup>[14]</sup></a> This, youthful Swindler, is
the besetting danger; hence, bend all your energies to
obtain a stony look of self-possession. Though a constable
should put his “dead hand” upon your shoulder, and your
very marrow should thrill at the touch—your face must
remain motionless as the face of the Apollo Belvidere—your
eye unquenched—your voice with not a crack in it.
I will not disguise the difficulties of arriving at this super-human
placidity. Talk of the self-possession of a Cæsar—the
coolness of a Napoleon—quackery all! What is there
in the composure of a man who takes snuff whilst hundreds
of other men’s limbs are being blown into the air (to be
wept over by the spirits of glory), with at the most a <i>sauve
qui peut</i> for it; whilst, in the scale of advantage, there is a
laurel wreath and a triumphant entry and civic addresses,—what
is all this to the quiet dignity demanded of a swindler
in a perilous situation—his splendid cabriolet, perhaps,
waiting at the shop—whilst, sneaked out at the back
door, Bob the apprentice has run for Police Officer
Snatchem, F. No. 20, to attend immediately to our hero,
who at his approach beholds a no dim vision of the very
handsome police omnibus—the prison barber with his
ignominious shears—and hears, or thinks he hears, the
pathetic, admonitory address of Common Sergeant or
Recorder? It may, according to a worn metaphor, take
nerves of iron to direct an army; but they must be brass,
and of the finest brass too, to swindle. Fighting is, indeed,
a mechanic trade; millions can fight,—but how few can
gracefully swindle! We know that the result of both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>operations is often the same, but how inferior one to the
other! Bonaparte brought a <i>few</i> pictures from Italy,
which the world—Heaven knows!—made noise enough
about. In warlike phrase he “took them” from a
vanquished people: a poor, shabby act to brag of; but
had he, unassisted by squadrons and battalions, and parks
of artillery—had he, by the unassisted efforts of his own
mind, with no other masked battery, no other weapon than
his own hand and his own tongue,—had he robbed one
dealer of a Correggio—another of a Raphael—a third of a
Titian—a fourth of a Murillo—and so on,—it had indeed
been an achievement to boast of; but to crack of the
incident as one of the trophies of the army of Italy was
the sublime of gasconading! My late friend Featherfinger—he
died, poor fellow, having burst a blood-vessel from
intense study at Macquarrie Harbour—had a magnificent
bronze clock; a superb thing! a thing to make a man
value time. Had I not pledged my honour to secrecy, I
could write a history touching his possession of that clock,
which, of itself, is enough to immortalise any one man.
My honour, however, is sacred; and my lips are hushed.
This much, probably, I may be permitted to observe: The
industry—nay, that is a poor, unworthy term—the genius
manifested by the indefatigable Featherfinger to possess
that clock—methinks I see him now; poor fellow! seated
with his Greek cap, his black satin morning gown figured
with pink poppies—an Indian shawl (the <i>gage d’amour</i>
of an Italian countess) about his waist—his feet in bead-embroidered
slippers, the work, as he protested, of some
heart-devoted heiress—his meerschaum in his mouth—in
his hand a book, <i>Satan</i> or the <i>Lives of Highwaymen</i> (for he
was passionately fond of light literature)—his tiger page,
only three feet high, and warranted to grow no taller, in
green and gold, with a breast-plate of best double gilt
buttons, standing at a reverential distance—whilst the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>bronze clock on the mantelpiece vibrated with its monitory,
moralising—yes, moralising—<i>tick, tick!</i> Methinks I see
him as I enter raise one eye from the page, nod, smile—and
such a smile!—there was only one shopkeeper, and
he was a philosophical member of the Society of Friends
and dealer in <i>virtu</i>, that ever stood against it—smile, and
then cast the other eye towards the clock itself with a look
of touching reproach at my delay, or with a glance of
approving pleasure at my punctuality. Methinks I see him—Gracious
powers! That such a man should die at
Macquarrie Harbour, taxed beyond his strength of study,
a victim to—but no; loyalty to the Ministry was ever
a virtue of the Whitefeathers, and I breathe no word
against the Whigs! To hurry from the theme. Much
has been said about the boldness, the fine contempt
of public opinion shown by Napoleon when he took
the horses of St Mark from Venice to place them on
his own palace gate in Paris. Well, the act was not
without its merit, but did I dare to write the story of
Featherfinger’s clock, the theft of Napoleon would, in
comparison to the genius manifested by my friend, sink
to the petty larceny committed by schoolboys upon
apple stalls. But so it is; the finest history remains,
and ever will remain, unwritten. The Venice horses
have been celebrated by poets and historians, but posterity
is left to bewilder itself with guesses on Featherfinger’s
clock. Yet—and I am prepared to meet the
consequences of such an assertion—I am convinced that
great as the conqueror was in all the varieties of the
science, Buonaparte’s horses must pass from the recollection
of the earth; whereas Featherfinger’s clock, duly chronicled,
was a thing for time! It may be cited as an illustration of
the injustice of Fortune—of the tricks she plays with the
noble and the man—when the reader is informed that the
tiger page of my dear friend—of him whose bones are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>mouldering (for he <i>was</i> buried) in a foreign earth—of him
born, as the poet says—</p>

<p class='c026'>that that little cab-page—that tiger-moth fluttering as I
have seen him with <i>billet-doux</i> about the carriage-lamps
and round the torches of an opera night,—that he has
at this moment a country-seat and grounds at Hackney,
purchased and supported by the precarious profits of a
night-house—that is, of a mansion hospitably open in the
vicinity of Drury Lane, for the refreshment of travellers
with beer, beef and oysters, from eleven at night until six
in the morning. But so it is; a genius, like my departed
friend, dies beggared at the last; whilst mere industry at
forty-five grows his own pine apples!</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>I have, I trust, been sufficiently minute in my description
of the face requisite to be put upon Swindling. In conclusion,
I have only to enforce the necessity of the most rigid
self-discipline to prevent even the most evanescent exhibition
of what is conveniently called modesty; for the swindler who
can blush is lost. His must be a brow whereon</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>A money-lender, a courtier, steeped to the lips in broken
promises—a pick-pocket caught in the act, all of these may,
if they can, blush and not be ruined; but woe to the
swindler whose cheek admits the self-accusing tint! His
face, like the face of the man in the moon, must look down
upon all sorts of acted abominations, yet blench not.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Mustachios.</span>—These <i>were</i> pretty things for the profession;
but I grieve to say it, lawyers’ clerks, linen-drapers’
apprentices, players out of place, and even pedestrian
vendors of lucifer matches, have detracted from their
exclusive importance; hence, I would counsel the youthful,
sanguine swindler to eschew what indeed vulgar usage has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>rendered a very questionable advantage, and to swindle
with clean lips. It is enough to break the heart of a rabbi
to see how one of “Heaven’s best gifts,” the human beard,
is in these hirsute days cut and notched according to the
impudence or ignorance of the wearer. It is said of the
French that they have a thousand ways of cooking an
egg: let it be our boast that we have as many modes of
dressing the chin. I have, I hope, a love of the picturesque,
as the world will one day know from a work of mine still,
unhappily, in manuscript.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c017'><sup>[15]</sup></a> I, therefore, am a passionate
admirer of the beard of patriarchal growth; but for your
nasty, stunted, straggly, ragged, edgy things—now like the
skin of a dog with the mange, now like the end of a skein
of whitey-brown thread, now as if culled from chopped
hay, and now as if cut from a singed blanket—pah!—were
I caliph for a day—but no matter, let me not wander to
legislation, but stick to my higher subject—Swindling. I
say, then, to my disciple, eschew mustachios. At best they
are a doubtful good. If, however, you are determined to
wear them, let me hope that their hue is black as death.
If, on the contrary, Heaven has awarded you a pair of pale
gold or deep carrot colour, tamper not with them, but
shave. Never, like Richard, think to stand “the hazard
of the <i>die</i>”; if so, your case is desperate. I knew three
promising young fellows, all of whom laid their ruin at the
door of Mr Rowland. But—for I like to anticipate—it
may be asked, Do you always, Captain Whitefeather, walk
abroad with unrazored lips? To this I boldly answer that—for
I was justified in the vanity—I did wear an adorned
mouth; more, that a lady, who shall be nameless, was in
hysterics (of course at intervals) for three days, when my
mustachios fell; but no, I could not condescend to wear
them when I saw—yes, I confess it—even a better pair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>than my own upon the face of a fellow in the Surrey gallery,
selling play-bills, Spanish nuts, and ginger beer. What the
revolution of society may in time produce it would of
course be impudence in me, who am not a Paternoster Row
astrologer, to declare; but, for the next five-and-twenty
years, mustachios will, I think, be a dangerous decoration
for the swindler. So much business has been done with
them that suspicion will have scarcely subsided under at
least another quarter of a century. The horse-tails of Ibrahim
Pacha have not been more triumphant; but victory will not
always perch upon the same banner.</p>

<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>OF THE PARENTAGE AND NAME OF A SWINDLER—OF HIS EQUIPAGE—OF HIS MORAL PHILOSOPHY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>The</span> professor of our distinguished art has, it must be
conceded, this peculiar and most grateful advantage—he
may choose his ancestors. With the <i>Peerage</i> or the <i>Red
Book</i> open before him, it lies within his own breast to decide
whether he shall have come from the loins of a Norman
baron—of one of the boldest of that invincible band of
marauders and thieves who jumped on Hastings beach—or
whether he shall be the last of a collateral branch of the
Strozzi, or Frangepani, or of any other Italian house whose
beginning, in the opinion of divers heralds, dates from
beyond Numa. Here is a glorious prerogative! The
swindler may make his own coat-of-arms, although his
immediate father walked the earth without a shirt. Show
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>me any other man possessing so delicious a privilege. With
long rolls of knights and barons, and earls and princes
before him, how the swindler may play the epicure with the
mighty dead! How loftily, yet how serenely, may he
contemplate the titled dust of bygone generations! Even as
your dainty snuff-taker coquets with a dozen samples of the
odoriferous tobacco, so may the swindler, pondering on a
choice of father and mother, taste with his moral sense the
various claims of buried greatness. Now, he likes this
Prince’s mixture—and now this. He is puzzled, perplexed
by the hundred appeals to his filial affection. He is one
minute determined to have come from the Montmorencys—the
next, he feels a yearning towards the Talbots—and in a
few seconds, lo! he will make a kindred to himself from
the golden line of D’Este. If the reader possess imagination—and
if he do not I tremble for my book—he must
sympathise with the delightful tumult in the swindler’s
brain and breast, or rather brain alone—(for with your
true swindler the brain must have played the Aaron’s rod
with the heart, swallowing it whole; a miracle very often
performed in the anatomy of great public men)—he must
feel more than commonly interested in the contest which is
to decide the parentage of our hero. With this allusion to
the delicacy of the juncture, we leave the swindler at his
books, merely impressing upon him the necessity of choosing
a long way back—of electing an ancestor from some by-way
catacomb—some seldom visited cemetery—some
“untrod on corner i’ the earth.” Nor let him despair;
there are at least a round thousand or two of dukes and
princes sufficiently obscure in their winding-sheets, albeit
possibly brave and blatant enough when in the flesh, from
whom the swindler may scratch out a great progenitor. All
that is necessary is that the beginner of the family shall
have lived in the dim twilight of civilisation—that he shall
be so far away that all the Herald’s Colleges, with all their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>spectacles upon their collective noses, shall not be able to
perceive whether the disentombed thing be flesh or phantom.
Very satisfactory progenitors have been found, with arms to
match, of thew and sinew just as questionable. If, however,
the swindler <i>will</i> have a mighty ancestor, let him, I repeat,
go far enough for him: when a man wants a marquis, or
an earl, or a count, for his great-grandfather, he should not
grudge a long walk—even though he walk blindfold and
backwards—for the commodity. So much for the ambitious
swindler.</p>
<p class='c010'>The swindler, however, who trusts to his unassisted genius,
and disdains the lustre of any specious trophies from the
churchyard, may with a very laudable pride refuse to make
to himself a grandfather, being possibly contented with the
grandsire selected by his grandmother for him. Some men—and
let me do all homage to their simplicity—turn up
their noses at the genealogical tree, even though its roots
were struck at Tyburn: the swindler of sanguine spirit may
be of this proud kidney; and all the better: I augur more
of his ultimate triumph. However, though he shall refuse
a herald-begotten progenitor, it may be highly necessary for
him that he shall choose a name. His own may have become
celebrated for family achievements wide away of his purpose;
and therefore, whilst with filial affection he sticks to his
own father and mother, disdaining the blood of Norman,
Guelph, or Ghibelline—it may be imperative upon him to
assume a nominal device not hitherto borne by any of his
kin. The swindler wants a name. Here, then, we approach
a delicate, yes, a difficult point. Let me, however, set out
with a solemn injunction to the swindler, that in the choice
of a name “he throw away ambition.” Considerable nicety
is required in the selection of a good title for swindling; a
number of fine young fellows having—if I may lighten the
solemnity of this essay with a familiar phrase—“let the cat
out of the bag” by the incautious assumption of a high-sounding,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>flowery, no-meaning patronymic. The truth is,
the detestable rage for novels has so familiarised the world
with a set of sugar-and-water heroes—of exquisite gentlemen,
all of them worthy of a glass case lest the flies should
soil them—that their very excess of virtue has put them on
the hue and cry of suspicion. Hence “<i>Delacour</i>,” “<i>Erpingham</i>,”
“<i>Rosenthorp</i>,” “<i>Millefleur</i>,” and a thousand others
of the courtly and sweet-smelling class, all in their time
excellent names for swindling (that is, for swindling in the
higher sense of the term, for in “fine wire wove” they
swindle still), are now no other than brands, <i>stigmata</i>, by
which the calling of the professor is instantly suspected.
Hence, my dear pupil, take no sweet, pastry-cook name from
a novel; cull no flower from a play-bill; but look, as either
a poet or a member of Parliament says, I forget which, “look
abroad into universality” for the thing desired. As you
walk the street cast your eyes above the door of the worthy
shopkeeper. A thousand to one that in a day’s saunter you
will possess yourself, and from such a source, of a name in
every respect unexceptionable. Yes, from the board of
the thriving, honest, painstaking, till-respecting tradesman.
And if so, how ingenious, how pleasant withal, to obtain
one of your best weapons from, so to speak, the armoury of
the enemy, to be fleshed immediately upon him! It is
perhaps unnecessary to warn the young swindler that he
must not be too homely in his choice. There is a class of
names which, from their very abundance, makes it a matter
of constructive ignominy to swindle under them. And some
of these are Jones, Walsh, Welsh, Thomson, Johnson,
Dobson, White, Brown, Williams, Simpson, Smithson, and
that multitudinous monosyllable, Smith! If, in a moment
of hilarity you break a lamp, wrench off a knocker, or snap
a bell wire, why any one of these names may be, as of course
every gentleman well knows, confidently given in to the night
constable; but to attempt to swindle under them betrays a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>petty larceny spirit in the professor, from which my experience
looks for little present gain or future reputation. No;
the name of a swindler should be like the wardrobe of the
true gentleman—a thing not challenging vulgar attention;
but, if examined, found to be of the very best material and
of the choicest workmanship. Hence let the swindler choose
between a <i>clinquant</i> (I do believe this is almost the first
bit of French appearing in the essay, for the which I
confess myself deficient in the graces of modern literature<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c017'><sup>[16]</sup></a>),
between the <i>clinquant</i> of novel heroes and the homeliness
of “base mechanics”—let his name be a solid, substantial,
downright English name.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>I say English, for I think we have had too long a peace to
render the assumption of a foreign title and a foreign accent
worth the trouble, the incessant watchfulness, the continual
stretch of a man’s intellects: the call upon his faculties to
keep up the character should be well rewarded, for the hazard
of self-discovery is very great. I know a remarkable instance
of the danger. There was Thaddeus Ballynamuck—he once,
with merely a backward touch of his hand, broke the jaw of
the manager of a minor theatre who dared to offer him terms
to bring him out as a Patagonian giant—there was Thaddeus,
who had made a splendid six weeks’ campaign at the West-end
as an Italian count; how admirably did he with the
<i>lingua Toscana</i> flavour his native Connaught! The Duke
of Tuscany was his dear friend; and not without reason;
for Thaddeus at a boar hunt had stood between the boar
and the duke, receiving the tusks of the beast in his hunting
jacket, for the which he had obtained a great many Italian
orders, and on the strength of which he gave a great many
English ones. Well, Thaddeus, though considered as true
an Italian as the poet Asso,<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c017'><sup>[17]</sup></a> was one morning driven to the
necessity of shaving himself, changing his southern name,
and retiring for a few weeks to the privacy of Southend.
He was betrayed into self-discovery by an excess of benevolence—the
more was the pity. Thus it was. He always
carried in his cab a beautiful dove-coloured Italian greyhound,
its legs not much thicker than goose quills, and its
tail like bent wire—the gift of the Marchesa di Lungabarba.
The dog had leaped from the cab and followed its master
into the office of Finings, the wine merchant. Thaddeus
had before very considerably patronised Finings, and was
about to give him a splendid order for some choice port to
be shipped to his friend the duke—and how the eyes of
Finings twinkled at the title of his highness!—when the
cellarman, a brawny, heavy fellow from Somerset, shambled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>into the office and trod, with all his fourteen stone, upon the
delicate toes of Angelo the greyhound: the dog howled with
agony piercing enough to crack the parchment heart of an
old maid, when the Captain—he was, at the moment, with
the greatest difficulty endeavouring to make himself understood
to the wine merchant—turned round, and, to the
astonishment of Finings, fulminating a string of oaths in
the very purest Connaught, dealt a blow on the breast of
the cellarman that sent him prostrate on three dozen of
choice brandy—picked samples for the dowager Lady
Drinkwater—to their utter destruction, and to the exceeding
surprise of the wine merchant, who had never in all his
life heard an Italian count vituperate such beautiful, such
unadulterate Irish. I will not continue the story: Thaddeus
Ballynamuck, though an admirable artist, fell a victim to
the exuberance of his feelings; as a swindler he was
professionally killed by Angelo, the late Marchesa di
Lungabarba’s greyhound.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f17'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r17'>17</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Captain doubtless means Tasso—[<span class='sc'>John Jackdaw</span>, Ed.].</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'>I have narrated this little history that it may serve as an
illustration of the perils besetting an honest, simple, guileless
Englishman who might wish to swindle as an exotic. There
is, it must be allowed, unnecessary peril in the experiment;
besides I question if it be not unpatriotic. Why defraud
our mother country of the advantage of our reputation?
Why, with ungrateful, with unfilial hand add a leaf to the
laurel of Germany—of France—of Italy—of Russia? No;
for a true born Briton to swindle as a noble from the Hartz
mountains—as a count from Paris—a Roman count—or a
prince from St Petersburg—is poor, shuffling, shabby, or,
if I may use a term which I am proud to find of late very
current among politicians and political writers (for the classes
are more distinct than people are prone to imagine)—it is
<i>Un-English</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>America, however, has her claims upon us. The swindler
may, and with profit, prove his recollection of the ties that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>once bound Columbia to Britain—may gratefully acknowledge
a sense of the relationship between the mother and the
daughter country, by swindling as a gentleman with enormous
possessions in New York, or, what is still better, in Virginia.
Here the many-sided philosopher cannot fail to recognise
a new advantage in a community of language. The
<i>soi-disant</i> (hem! French again!), the <i>soi-disant</i> American
swindler may avenge the injuries of a greyhound on the
person of a cellarman, yet run no risk of discovery. He
may still run up and down the gamut of execration and not
betray himself. Think of this, youthful swindler. Besides,
there is another great temptation to offer this passing honour
to America. Her unsettled currency affords the swindler a
hundred plausible excuses if—for such improprieties do occur
at the London Hotel, Grillon’s, the Clarendon, all the very
best of houses—if rudely pressed to show those credentials of
gentility which even the rudest and the most illiterate never
fail to acknowledge. Thus the swindler may for a time
throw himself upon the banks: and this the more safely if
he have displayed a handful of letters of introduction (a
few to the royal household), all easily manufactured, and
all, for the time, as good as letters of credit. There is
another very practicable deceit. He may, on the night of his
arrival in London, have his pocket picked of certain Government
securities, and, having made the keeper of the hotel
the depository of his secret, straightway advertise the
loss in all the papers. This, I confess, is a ticklish experiment,
demanding the finest self-possession, the greatest
delicacy to carry it into successful operation; and if the
youthful swindler have any doubts of himself, I charge him
by his hopes of future profit and reputation not to think of
hazarding it. Should he, however, succeed, and the landlord
advance liberally, he may condescend to express his
best wishes for the prosperity of his host, and more, may
invite himself to dine with him. Great caution, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>is to be used before there be any advance to such familiarity;
and yet I once knew a gentleman from Natchez who obtained
unlimited credit from his host—the pot-house keeper
was musical—by insisting upon it that he made Dibdin’s
“Lovely Nan” by the very force of expression remarkably
like Rossini. So far, all was well; but, forgetful of what
was due to himself as a swindler,—in the genial atmosphere
of a domestic hearth letting himself down to the level of
his host—the foolish fellow suffered himself to play at cribbage
with his landlord; a man who had spent at least half of
his long and useful life, pegging. Game after game the
landlord’s doubts increased: and at length he rose from the
table with a blank in his face, and all the swindler’s bill in
his heart. “I’m done—I know I’m done!” cried the host
with a groan. “I must be done, for no true gentleman could
ever beat me at cribbage.” At least one month’s board and
lodging, besides the greatest of all advantages, the first-rate
reference to shopkeepers, did my friend from Natchez
lose by his skill at cribbage. It is true when hard pressed
he talked a great deal about the last failure of the cotton
crop—an excellent theme, by the way—but in this case he
talked to the winds, or, what was much worse, to a man
obstinate upon his bill. My friend had to make an
ignominious retreat, leaving behind him all his goods generously
subscribed for him by the ingenuous West-end
shopkeepers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Notwithstanding this, the swindler may for a time take
America for his country. The trick is by no means over-done.
If, however, the swindler make the election—if he
resolve upon becoming a gentleman of enormous fortune
from the United States—he had better choose the South,
and, above all things, he must not forget the cotton crop.
As it once happened at New Orleans, much execution may,
even in London, be done upon the enemy from behind
cotton bags. As for his rank, the swindler should not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>venture beyond that of colonel—yes, a colonel and a great
grower of cotton.</p>

<p class='c010'>We next come to a most important subject—the dress of
the swindler. The present age judges of the condition of
men as we judge of the condition of cats—by the sleekness,
the gloss of their coats. Hence, in even what is called a
respectable walk of life, with men of shallow pockets and
deep principles, it is of the first importance to their success
that, if they would obtain three hundred per annum, they
must at least look as if they were in receipt of seven. Very
many stoical privations are endured for this great purpose.
How many a fine hungry fellow carries his dinner upon his
back—his breakfast in his beaver—his supper in his boots!
The Hottentot is not the only human animal that clothes
itself with the cost of bowels. The swindler, however, is
not—fate forbid that it should be so!—called upon to make
the same sacrifice required every day in London of the poor,
friendless student—of the miserable, unknown artist—the
juvenile surgeon, panting for a practice—the barrister, without
a fee—the curate, with lips hungering for even locusts and
wild honey—the thousands of God’s most helpless creatures,
gentlemen, born with a silver spoon, but left by fortune at
their maturity without any employment for knife and fork—no,
no, it is the purpose, the triumph of swindling to put
its professors in purple and fine linen, and to make “their
eyes red with wine and their teeth white with milk.” They
have to dress well, not to keep up the barren name of
gentleman, but to flourish as swindlers. Poor Dactyl, the
poet—astonishing truth!—is too proud to take credit for a
hat—too poor to buy one—and too high-spirited to nod to
his old college friends in a rusty beaver. Will the reader
listen to a fact? What does Dactyl? Why, he makes a
compromise with his magnanimity—he over-persuades
himself that his beaver is as yet tolerably jetty, since all
the summer he has once a day sponged it with a damp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>sponge, and kept religiously upon the shady side of the
pavement. I mention this wretched shift of a pusillanimous
spirit to show to the young swindler what might be his
fate if, with a pertinacity only found in simpletons of
the very first class, he would resolve to live the gentleman
upon the revenue of the chameleon; and, with not a sixpence
in his pocket, would be sufficiently mad to rave about
honour in his bosom. What is the reward of such obstinacy—what
the goal of men so honourably idle—so perversely
pure? What the end? Go,—ask it of the Thames! Put
the question to the Serpentine—the New River—the
canals! Mutter the query as you pause at the gunsmith’s—as
you linger at the chemist’s! Ask, as you see
whisk by you the chariot of the coroner!</p>

<p class='c010'>I had not touched upon this mean-spirited class of
bipeds—of the species, many of whom die off in honourable
poverty, and many in a dishonourable horse-pond—did not
swindling save a third portion of the body from a life of
starvation and an end of vulgar misery. The good,
indulgent parents who, in submission, as they conceive,
to the high civilisation of the day, will rather let their
sons be nothing if they cannot put them in a fair way to
become archbishops, chancellors, and commanders-in-chief,
owe much to swindling, for—urbane goddess!—how often
does she take the pet of the fireside—the darling of the
chimney corner—the pretty prodigal, when plucked of
every feather by the jackdaws<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c017'><sup>[18]</sup></a> of the town, and make of
him again a bird of finest plumage. Yes, thousands and
thousands of young gentlemen, shamefully deserted by
their parents when they had not a farthing more to leave
them, and—wanting a calling—with nothing to do, have
been received with open arms by the tenderest of foster-mothers;
and not only once more set upon their legs, but,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>perhaps, for the first time in their lives, put into their
own cabriolets! Little thinks the plodding tradesman,
determined upon making Tom a gentleman, that his dear
boy may owe all the external appearances of that character
to nought but swindling. But I have wandered.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f18'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r18'>18</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I persuade myself that Captain Whitefeather here meant
nothing personal.—[<span class='sc'>John Jackdaw</span>, Ed.]</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The swindler must dress well—very well; nay, he must
be rather over-dressed than under-dressed. If his means be
scanty, he must on the outset, if I may use the phrase of a
celebrated bill discounter, late of the New Cut—he must
“spend his money superficially”; that is, as the before-named
fiscal authority condescended to explain, he must
expend a little in such a way that the outlay may appear
very considerable. He must, however, continually bear this
in mind, that in this our beloved country—in England—the
empress of nations—the queen of reason—the genius of
toleration—and the benefactress of the oppressed—nearly
everything depends upon a man’s coat. Great and rich
is he indeed who can afford to confront the midday sun in
threadbare cloth. It matters not what may be your genius—what
your worth; you must make the success of that
genius apparent—you must publish the reward of that
worth; you must assure men’s eyes that you are a fine
gentleman, or you will, with all your glorious aspiration, be
passed, confounded with the mob. The triumphs of mind
are to the trading million too subtle, too abstract, to
be easily grasped; but the quality of a man’s coat—the
gorgeousness of his vest—the chain of finest carat—the ring
of brightest sparkle—all of these are so many indisputable
evidences of worldly success, and are, therefore, to be continually
carried about by a man as universal vouchers for
his character. John Bull has certainly the largest eyes of
any of the nations. Hence, if it be imperative upon men
with even a known calling to exhibit an outward sign of the
prosperity of that craft, how much more is it incumbent on
us—the minions of Mercury, with nothing but the vivacity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>of our wits “to feed and clothe” us—to put a splendid outside
upon swindling, and since the world ducks to appearance,
to assure ourselves of its very, very lowest stooping!
I have never yet known an instance of a successful swindler
in a shabby coat. Who, indeed, would trust a man with a
hole in his hat? Read the Police Reports—those “short
and simple annals”—how, nineteen times out of twenty, do
they commence? Why, thus—“Algernon Mountedgecomb,
a young man dressed in the highest style of fashion,” etc.,
etc. Such is always the strain; for can the reader point
out any case with any verbal similarity to the following:—“Yesterday,
John Snooks, a wretchedly attired fellow, was
brought up charged with obtaining under false pretences a
diamond ring, a gold repeater, and a suit of pearls from the
house of——?” Has ever such a case been chronicled?
Certainly not: hence, the tailor is indispensable to the
swindler, who is on no account to spare him. The swindler
may, in the weakness of his nature, have some qualms
towards any one except a tailor; but the swindler who deals
mercifully with a tailor had better seek another profession—such
chicken-heartedness is not for our art. The benevolence
is so much goodness lost—wasted—flung to the winds;
for you are to bear with you this recollection: it is an axiom
in his trade, that the tailor never loses. “Them as does
pay”—such was the confession of an eminent coatmaker
after his second bottle of Burgundy drank at Button Park,
his country seat—“them as does pay,” said the good man,
“pays for them as doesn’t.” Can there be a finer provision
for the protection of trade, and the satisfaction of the non-paying?
Hence, if possible, flay your tailor. Should he
discount—for there are such philanthropists—let him have
a few bills by all means. In his vast profits what are two
or three thousands more or less in a twelvemonth’s balance?
<i>If</i>, however, he will not discount the paper of your friends—“accommodate”
is a good word—he cannot refuse your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>own bill. Great is the satisfaction of a bill! What serenity
comes upon a man’s soul when he hath writ “accepted”!
What a load he feels lifted from his lightened heart! How
airily, how joyously he looks around him, elevated with a
sense of duty done to his neighbour and to himself! Sweet,
most sweet, the satisfaction! Such I am sure was the feeling
of my late lamented friend, Captain Judas Gammon;
for that excellent fellow never accepted a bill that he did
not clasp his hands and, raising his eyes with a devout look
of thanksgiving, exclaim, “There now—thank heaven—!
that’s paid!”</p>

<p class='c010'>There is, however, one objection to a bill—it puts another
pair of wings to the back of Time. Hence, get a long
day. He was a philosopher and knew human nature, and
more than all, those profound workings of the human
heart set going by the machinery of bills,—he <i>was</i> a
sage who, at the Old Bailey bar,—what men of wit and
genius have made that nook all classic ground!—having
received sentence of seven years’ retirement from the bustling
world, thus, with smiling face, addressed the judge:—“I
beg your pardon, my lord, but have you a stamp about
you? if so, permit me to accept a bill at seven years, for
then they’ll pass like one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Next for equipage. A swindler, like a physician, can
scarcely hope to prosper on foot. He must <i>ride</i> to fame
and fortune: hence a cab is of the first consequence to
him. This, however, is too obvious to call for further
disquisition. The effect of a magnificent cab—a grey blood—and
a diminutive fancy tiger—upon the sensibilities of the
shopkeeping world are every day made manifest by the
Police Reports. Jonathan Wild, Richard Turpin, and
other worthies laboured on horseback—civilisation adds to
their less bloodthirsty descendants the comforts and the
graces of a cab.</p>
<div id='i256'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i256.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Other worthies laboured on horseback</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c009'>And now, come we to the moral bearing of the swindler.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Destiny has marked him to play a very various character.
He is, I will not attempt to disguise it, beset by difficulties.
There are men, assuredly, born with a genius for the profession;
who, as it would seem, instinctively adapt themselves
to all its peculiarities; men who would have been lost,
sacrificed, utterly unknown in any other calling. I do
not address myself to them—this luminous work is not
written for their instruction; but to the thousands of the
rising generation, induced, tempted, by the spirit of the
times—a spirit of the most tyrannic gentility—to live without
means; to eat the fat of the land without once greasing
their delicate fingers in search of it. Let these, however,
not conclude that our path lies over flowers: by no means;
there are very many rubs to be endured on the way—rubs
calling for at once the greatest self-possession and the
most admired meekness. Indeed, I should not discharge a
great public duty did I not state it as my conviction that
very far less powers of mind, and ingenuity of a much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>lower scale, are found sufficient to make a fortune in any
of the low mechanic arts of life than are required by even
the humblest swindler. However, the ardour of youth is
not to be withstood; hence our best choice is to instruct
and fortify it.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now, neophyte swindler, let me put a few questions
to you. And ere you answer, submit to a most rigorous
self-examination—search every hole and corner of your
heart; and then hold up your head and reply unblushingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Can you bear what is called public contempt? Are you
clothed with a moral armour, more impenetrable than the
scales of the dragon—from which the glances of reproach,
the scoffs, the sneers, the hard abuse of vulgar minds—the
mere pity of those prigs who call themselves philanthropists—shall
fall aside unfelt and unremembered?</p>

<p class='c010'>Can you school yourself to look in all human faces—for
this trial <i>will</i> come—and find them blank?</p>

<p class='c010'>Have you sufficient fortitude to witness unrepiningly the
good fortune of some early companion—a dullard, yet
plodding, and what the world calls honest—surrounded
with all the luxuries of life, the fruits of lowly huckstering,
when, possibly, you yourself are yearning for a tester?</p>

<p class='c010'>Can you bear with the nerves of a martyr the visitation
of a horse-whip—for I will not shirk any of the probabilities
that wait upon the profession—or the vindictive and un-Christianlike
application of a pointed boot to the <i>os sacrum</i>?<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c017'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f19'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r19'>19</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“It is very strange,” remarks Captain Whitefeather in one
of his unpublished essays, “On Personal Satisfaction,” “how
very few men know what is due to themselves and to the second
party, in inflicting what they call personal chastisement. I have,”
continues the Captain, with that delightful ingenuousness which
made him the soul of his circle, “I have been kicked, horsewhipped,
cudgelled, tossed in a blanket, pumped upon and flung
into a horse-pond, yet I never, but in one instance, met with a
man who thrashed me <i>like a gentleman</i>?”—[<span class='sc'>John Jackdaw</span>, Ed.]</p>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Can you, at proper time and season, bear your nose pulled?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>I am aware that this is perhaps the most difficult, the most
trying ordeal for the weakness of human nature to withstand;
and therefore, I repeat the question—Can you bear
your nose pulled?</p>

<p class='c010'>Can you, with no qualms at your throat, behold in rags
or in a gaol the simple gull who has trusted you, or who—more
exquisitely simple still—has become your surety?</p>

<p class='c010'>Can you, when old age approaches, and your place in the
world is filled up by more active, more youthful professors—can
you, with your hand upon your heart, retire like a
philosopher to a corner, and with not an eye to look comfort
to you, not a lip to breathe hope to you, not a hand to
grasp your hand—can you breathe your last breath with the
conviction that you have done no injury to the dead, will
leave no wounds in the living—and that having passed a
life in heroic defiance of human prejudices, you meet
death with the magnanimous indifference of a roasted
Indian?</p>

<p class='c010'>Consider, my dear pupil, whether you are so happily
organised that you can support these trials—too often
attendant on our chivalrous profession—and answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>The pupil laughs at the impossibility of such evils, and,
chuckling at the fun, says—I can.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Swindling takes him to her arms and makes him all
her own!</p>

<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='sc'>A Brief Summary of the Advantages of Swindling</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>I have</span>, I hope, made it sufficiently plain to the plainest
understanding that the faculty, the desire to swindle, is born
with us, and that it is entirely owing to the force of circumstance
whether we swindle or not; and that, however nice, and
moral, and exemplary, we may be in our individual capacity,
swindle we must and do, when we congregate together, even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>with what are termed and considered the very best intentions.
This being granted, let every man with all possible speed
enroll himself as one of a body corporate. He may be a
most rigid member of a Temperance Society, considering
the parish pump the only source of all human enjoyment;
and yet, as one of a body, he may drive a very pretty trade
in opium. He may, to his great self-exaltation, hold a plate
in aid of the funds for the dissemination of the true faith;
and yet the diamond on his finger may have been purchased
with an odd balance of the profits which, as one of a company,
he receives from a Hindoo idol. What the superficial
world denominates and brands as swindling in the individual
it applauds as spirited speculation, wisdom, foresight, a
fine knowledge of business in a number. Hence, if a man
would swindle safely, steadily, and above all, respectably,
let him become one of a public company, and his dearest
wish is straight fulfilled. What a profound liar he may be
on the Stock Exchange, and yet what an oracle of truth
at his own fireside! How he is permitted to rob his
neighbour by means of false intelligence, and what a roaring
he is justified in setting up should some famishing,
unprincipled scoundrel lessen by one the numerous tenants
of the good man’s hen-roost! Reader, if you are not
already enrolled, become one of a body. Though you may
be only able to edge yourself into a vestry, it shall be something.
And what a relief it is for the individual man, compelled
to walk half his time through the world in tight moral
lacing, to be allowed to sit at his ease at the Board! If
morality sigh for leisure, where can it be enjoyed if not in
a company! Once in a company, how many Catos become
Antonys!</p>
<p class='c010'>To the rising generation the advantages of swindling are
incalculable. The term swindling is, at present, an ugly one;
but with the advancement of the world it will be considered as
another and a better system of ethics. To obtain all things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>needful for the refined man, by the exercise of the moral
faculties, is, doubtless, the greatest triumph of human
intellect, and this is inevitably achieved by the successful
practice of swindling.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is another advantage—another consolation—that
I have purposely left for consideration in this place.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the plodding, sober, thrifty man quits this noisy
world—made noisy by the incessant rattling of pounds,
shillings, and pence—it is ten to one that he makes what is
generally called an irreparable gap in a large circle of the
most affectionate of friends. He leaves a widow broken-hearted—daughters
inconsolable—sons in the deepest
affliction—nieces and nephews very much concerned—and
innumerable acquaintances all ready, with very little
further excitement, to burst into tears. Now here is a
woe inflicted upon fifty people by the decease of one man—yes,
here are fifty people made more or less miserable by
a very natural event, the decease of a worthy soul, who
would not willingly inflict a moment’s pain upon any
living thing.</p>

<p class='c010'>How different the death of the swindler! He makes no
irreparable gap in society—not he! he agonises neither
man, nor woman, nor child; not a tear is dropped at his
grave—not a sigh rises at the earth rattling on his coffin!
Must not the conviction of this be the sweetest consolation
to the dying swindler? Think of his end, and——</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c010'>[It may be thought that the work ends abruptly. It does
so: the author had not leisure to finish it. The following
letter will, perhaps, throw some light upon the matter. It
was addressed by the Captain to an intimate friend:—</p>

<div class='c013'>“H.M. Transport, <i>Barrington</i>.</div>

<p class='c015'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Tom</span>,—We are off for blue water. Some papers of mine
are in a deal box in the two-pair back of the Bag-o-Nails. If you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>love me, see I’m in print. I learn from a fellow-shipmate—whose
only misfortune is that his handwriting was very similar to another
gentleman’s—that the papers will make a very pretty book, there
being a great call nowadays for the greatest information in the
smallest compass. You can pay in for me what you get through
the Home Office. Be wide awake, and believe me, under all
convictions,</p>

<p class='c015'>“P.S.—You know I never liked shaving; the chin’s bad
enough—but when it comes to the head, it’s ‘regular cruelty to
animals.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>The above is (“errors excepted”) a true copy of the
Captain’s letter. He died in—I regret to say I cannot
give the exact latitude: suffice it to say he died; but left
behind him what, I trust, will prove an imperishable
monument of his social worth and his exalted genius.—<span class='sc'>John

  <h2 class='c006'>THE EDITOR’S CHAPTER TO THE READER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>The</span> reader has, probably, marked a variety of style in the
foregoing pages. The Editor feels it to be due as much to
the lamented Captain Whitefeather as to himself to state
that he, John Jackdaw, is solely responsible for the manner
in which this work is presented to all the eyes of the
British public.</p>
<p class='c010'>Nature had been very prodigal to the Captain; but
whether from the extreme vivacity of his genius, or whether
from a more hidden cause, it is vain to search, the Captain,
with all his debts, owed nothing to art. Even his orthography
was of the happiest originality.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Editor, therefore, felt the peculiar delicacy of his
task. Had he printed the MS. as it came, with the bloom
upon it, from the Captain’s hand, it was to be feared that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>this age of light reading—which reading, like pills, is made
to be bolted, not, like bread, to be carefully chewed—not
one out of a hundred would have had the necessary patience
to go through with it. To suppress the work for any defect
of style would have been to sacrifice, as the Editor considered,
a great national good. After much deliberation
there appeared to him a golden mean. It struck the Editor
that he might, in very many instances, give the style of
Whitefeather, whilst in very many more he might heighten,
and adorn, and vary it from his own poor resources. Still,
be it understood, all the <i>facts</i> are Whitefeather’s; the
Editor only lays claim to certain tropes, and metaphors,
and inimitable felicities of expression, to which, probably,
it might be considered indelicate were he more emphatically
to allude. Indeed, he has only touched upon the theme
in the way of business; as there may be, even at this
moment, many noble and distinguished authors who, “wanting
the accomplishment” of grammar, are yet desirous of
appearing in print. (To these, in parenthesis, the author
addresses himself; assuring the tadpole <i>literati</i> that he
finishes tales, histories, biographies, poems, etc., with all
despatch, and with the most inviolable secrecy. His
address is in a former page, and Breakneck Steps is too
well known to all who would mount Parnassus.)</p>

<p class='c010'>To the publishers of the remains of Captain Whitefeather
the Editor has to express his warmest gratitude. The
Editor blushes for the intelligence of the trade, when he
states that this national work, like the hitherto inimitable
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, was offered in the humblest manner to
twenty houses, and, sometimes coldly, sometimes sulkily,
sometimes indignantly refused.</p>

<p class='c010'>One was tickled by the title, but looked blank when he
understood that there was no murderer—no highwayman in
it. He declared that the only way to keep a reader awake
was to commit at least one murder in every page; that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>gallows was now the only bay tree, and that even the youthful
generation sucked intelligence and morals from tales of
the gibbet, with the same eagerness and the same advantage
that they sucked liquorice root! “Season it, sir—season
it,” said one bland gentleman, “with a handful of murders—a
terrific storm on the New River—and a miraculous
escape from Marylebone watchhouse, and there may be
some hopes of it.” A second asked me to change the
title into “The Handbook of the Money Markets,” adding,
to my astonishment, that he had no doubt the staple of the
matter would serve equally well. A third—but why
should I enumerate the rebuffs endured? No; let me
rather, in the name of an obliged generation, register a
gratitude to the enlightened spirit under whose auspices the
book appears—a work destined, as the Editor with all
diffidence declares, to work a good as incalculable as,
perhaps, unknown!</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
